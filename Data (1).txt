Your letter made me very happy. I would like to come back to the matter of the skimpy birdfeed when I return to Zurich. At the moment I have to leave on a business trip. If I can arrange it, I’ll go to Arosa for a couple of days to see Tete. When Adn arrived yesterday with the letter, I was here, but they didn’t look for me properly. My train leaves in 2 hours. As regards health, incidentally, I am feeling infinitely better than last year.

With brilliant sunshine and sweet chocolate, it’s grand to read about the goings on in Berlin from up here. Monday the schoolmastering begins. This nest Zuoz is unbelievably attractive architecturally. 
##
Sparkling scenery and well fed citizens who have nothing to fear. That is what it looks like here. But God knows, I like people with cares, to whom the morrow looms large with uncertainty. How will everything turn out? It’s difficult to take one’s mind off the changed and still changing Berlin. I think it will turn out well, as I see it, when calm is restored again. The young people who have experienced all this won’t become bourgeois so soon.

Your friendly invitation pleased me very much. But this time you must kindly grant forgiveness. I’ve almost had to preach my lungs and brains out here already, so I have a proper craving for rest. Added to that, I actually don’t really have anything new to present, just a rehash. So let me go my own quiet way. As a mitigating circumstance I must add that my stay here has been delayed by 3 weeks anyway as a consequence of the “heating vacation,” which lasted until January 20th.

It is very welcome that Edgar Meyer is having Ehrenhaft’s experiments thoroughly rechecked for us. That the charges of a single particle are integral multiples [of e] is already completely secured. Another local physicist has carefully remeasured the magnetic gyroscope effect he found only half the theoretical value. It’s teeming here with (hungry) theoreticians. Abraham is here. Laue is soon coming over, Debye also wanted to come. They are all looking forward to Epstein.
##
For so long have I, beast that I am, not answered your heartwarming invitation! But that was because I did not know whether I ought to say yes or no. I so much want to see you all, you know, but on the other hand, traveling is so dreadful, particularly for someone with queasy insides. (By the way, I’m feeling very well, relatively.) I would also very much like to meet Bohr, this person of such magnificent intuitive talent. But it cannot be. For in January–February I lectured in Switzerland for 4 weeks and must lecture there for 4 weeks again in the summer. I cannot be away from here even more without it becoming indecent. Besides, I am very much behind with my course here, partly because of the Zurich lectures, partly because many courses here had to be canceled as a result of the university’s closing following the unrest. Finally, I am passionately occupied with a problem in general relativity that, night or day, won’t leave me in peace. Politics disappoint me very much these days. The states whose victory during the war I had felt would be by far the lesser evil are now proving to be only slightly the lesser evil. Added to that are the excessively dishonest local domestic politics. A reaction, with all its vile deeds under abhorrent revolutionary disguise! One doesn’t know where to look to get pleasure from human affairs. I get most joy from the emergence of the Jewish state in Palestine. It does seem to me that our kinfolk really are more sympathetic (at least less brutal) than these horrid Europeans. Perhaps things can only improve if only the Chinese are left, who refer to all Europeans with the collective noun “bandits.” I find Schouten’s idea about a precession attributable to relativity very smart, although not completely cogent. I actually wouldn’t have expected such a quick thought to come from him. Lorentz certainly was also delighted about it. A very able experimenter in Zurich (Dr. Beck) finds the gyromagnetic effect measured by De Haas and me only half as large as the theory requires. That man definitely has to be taken seriously. The measurements ought to be repeated in order to clear up or decide the matter.
##
Your new result is highly gratifying. I for my part am now convinced of the existence of the redshift. Special treatment of the individual lines would still be very desirable. You have done a great service to the cause with these two papers. I shall point this out emphatically to Mr. Nernst, in case it should be necessary. If you now clear up the matter with the Sun as well, confirmation of the theory’s most important result is then secured. I told Mr. Scheel that you and Mr. Kohlschütter want to give talks at the Ger man Physical Society. Your talks are supposed to take place very soon already. I ask you both kindly to contact him by telephone. 
##
Heartfelt thanks to all of you for the congratulations. I would have already thanked you if I weren’t so terribly swamped with work. Presently I have especially much at my fingertips, and the brain is not as flexible in this fifth decade now begun. It wasn’t as bad on my birthday as you think. With the exception of 5 Haberland St., no one here knew about the important event thank God! Here everything is taking its usual course again and superficially everything is calm. But I am convinced that, slowly but surely, the Bolshy is coming: “Whoever doesn’t work, shouldn’t eat either.” Yesterday this principle was applaudingly quoted to me by a brother academician, of all people. In one week I am giving a public talk for the benefit of the treasury of the Socialist Student Associationon the relativity principle, of course. Healthwise I am doing excellently, and otherwise too I feel comfortable here. Unless something quite horrible happens, I certainly won’t leave here. I am very sorry that you must go through so much with your legs. Even so, it is better to have nerve pain than something else because there’s nothing deep rooted about it. Another 50 marks will be sent to Marie D. it would have already happened if my female kin hadn’t forgotten. Now I have to go and the letter shouldn’t wait any longer. 
##
I am thrilled with your new paper like a child who gets a piece of chocolate from his mother. What you plant squarely on its feet is exactly what is crookedly limping and lurching every which way with me. Now I am sending you the proofs of a new paper that again relies far more on physical than on mathematical support, in that Hamilton’s principle by the same token must be given up. A brief note with your opinion of it would be of great interest to me. 
##
Surely you will remember the depressing conversations we had together, 3 years ago in Holland, about the war atrocities. The memory of your lively concern with these terrible things encourages me to present the following to you. A commission has been formed here by a few private individuals that has set for itself the task of scrupulously examining the accusations that have been publicized abroad, and were found to be justified, about Germany’s conduct of the war, by means of official documents here and, if possible, by foreign ones as well, and of publishing the results here. I myself am on the commission, along with five other people whose absolute honesty and genuine convictions and sense of justice I can vouch for. In order to acquire material to serve as a basis (a reference) for our claim and, where possible, documentary evidence, we must expand our commission membership to residents of foreign neutral countries. We would be happy if you, esteemed colleague, would join the commission. For, your great experience in human affairs as well as your name would be exceptionally useful to our endeavor. If, however, you do not wish to do this for any reason, I ask that you please refer me to someone in Holland who in your view would be willing and able to join our cause in the manner described. I believe the horrendous hatred will disintegrate gradually only when the bare truth is uncovered. There are many thoroughly honorable people here who consider all these serious claims to be tendentious lies, to the extent that they have filtered down to them in subdued form it is our goal to enlighten such people.
##
I read through your paper and find it very interesting. Nowhere do I see anything impossible yet. But on the other hand, I must admit that the arguments brought forward up to now do still seem to have far too little persuasive power. I would like to suggest that you first consider the following (perhaps before you publish the paper, although I do not want to presume to give you advice in this regard). It can be assumed according to your underlying idea, of course, that the geodesic lines inclined away from the slices ( = const) must yield the traces of the electrically charged particles under the simultaneous influence of a gravitational and an electromagnetic field. If you could show with the precision established by our empirical knowledge that this is true, I would be as good as convinced of the correctness of your theory. Your piece is too long for our Academy a resolution exists in this respect to which no exceptions are made. I can arrange, however, that the newly founded Mathematische Zeitschrift speedily print your report, because I know the editor (Prof. Lichtenstein) well. I could present a shortened version before the Academy only when the above question of the geodesic lines is cleared up. You cannot hold this against me, for when I present a paper, I attach my name to it. I myself definitely would not publish the idea if it had occurred to me before having done this test, which seems to be a secure and relatively simple criterion. 
##
You have had to suffer much hardship, as I sadly gather from your amicable and long letter. And yet, those of our kind are still better off than most others, for we are accustomed to placing the focus of our attention beyond personal experience. This kind of liberation is actually the most valuable thing that true culture can give a person. I am sorry that you devoted so much attention to my marginal notes in Study’s book they were jotted down hastily and with little care. I do see that Study does not do you justice. I gave you the book only because it is written with such wit and is amusing, not because I wanted to plead for that view. I find that his “realism” is philosophically quite foggy, only substantiated in the little book so that the reader gets a Molière like slap. I find the book General Theory of Knowledge [Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre] by M. Schlick, which takes a somewhat similar point of view, much more penetrating. If I find any fault with certain propositions posed by you with regard to the “fictions,” it is primarily that fictions are inherently contradictory. The concept “point,” for ex. is, in my view, not inconsistent if one realizes that what is involved here is merely a concept, not an object of perception. I absolutely do not see how this concept, within its own system, leads to mutually contradictory conclusions. The assumption that I held out the prospect of a paper for the Kant Studien is based on error. I am too little versed in philosophy to take an active part in it myself if I can be passively receptive to the work of the men in this field, I am content enough. I just promised to pass on information, verbally as well as in writing, about matters regarding my specialty in particular that are of interest to philosophers. This is the only way in which I can perhaps be of service to philosophy. Cobbler, stick to your last! I find your book very enjoyable and intend to absorb it bit by bit. I find in it a manner of looking at things that is very close to my own. Poincaré too is closely related to you. Study has treated him quite badly by pinning him down on a truly superficial comment about the practical significance of Euclidean geometry. Poincaré’s expositions on the place of geometry within the whole scientific system appear to me to be considerably more profound than Study’s.

Esteemed Miss! The desire to write to you has finally overcome the bad conscience that plagued me because I haven't replied to you for such a long time & that made me avoid exposing myself to your critical eyes. But even though you are rightfully a little angry with me, there is one thing you have to give me credit for, namely that rather than adding to my sin by taking shelter behind poor excuses, I am asking you simply and straightforwardly to forgive me and answer me as soon as possible. I am very happy about your intention to continue your studies here again, just do it pretty soon; I am sure you will not regret it. I am quite convinced that you will be able to catch up in a relatively short time with the main courses we had. To be sure, it puts me in a very embarrassing position if I have to tell you what material we covered. Simply, it's only here that you will find the material properly arranged and elucidated. Hurwitz lectured on differential equations (exclusive of partial ones), also on Fourier series, a little on calculus of variations & double integrals. Herzog on dynamics and strength of materials, on the latter very lucidly and well on dynamics somewhat superficially, which is quite natural with a "mass course." Weber lectured on heat (temperature, heat quantities, thermal motion, dynamic theory of gases) with great mastery. I am looking forward from one of his lectures to the next. Fiedler lectures on projective geometry, he is the same indelicate, rude man as before & in addition sometimes opaque, but always witty & profound in brief, a master but, unfortunately, also a terrible schoolmaster. The only other course of importance that will give you a lot to do is the theory of numbers, but you can make up this subject by studying privately at your leisure. If I am allowed to give you some advice (completely unselfishly?), it's that you come here as soon as possible, because here you will find everything you need compressed in our notebooks
##
There is enough to do, yet not excessively, so that sometimes I find the time to idle away an hour or so in the beautiful surroundings of Zurich. In addition I am happy at the thought that the worst worries are over for my parents. If all people would live in such a way (namely like myself), writing of novels would never have been born.

A good and proper scolding I just received brought you vividly to my mind, which will now immediately be documented by a little letter. To the paragon, a sample (of course of no value) untranslatable wordplay referring to a "sample without value" parcel. Has it arrived by now. If it has not, you mustn't beam in anticipation. It is not for eating. Oh, yes in emulation of famous examples, the letter for the paragon is also put into the sample a triple pun on "Muster" dared is half won. I am having a terrific time at home; I have been passing much of the time in inmost delights, that is to say, I have been eating quite a bit & quite well, so that I already suffered a little from our favorite poetic sorrows, like then at Sterns', when I was sitting for hours next to my fascinating charming female dinner partner. It was then that it struck me most vividly how closely our mental and physiological lives are linked. The journey was very nice, even though, unfortunately, all the fellow passengers were male creatures. There were, for example, a few nice and lively Italian youngsters, who sang & laughed & joked among themselves, half like young girls, half like puppies. I did fine in Chiasso. This fellow has nothing ???, the shrewd customs officer must have thought. While I most earnestly conversed about Italian conditions with a young man during the continuation of the trip, a German youth & business apprentice, who was traveling to Italy for the first time, was taking pains to dispose of the few occasional scraps of Italian, which he had acquired especially for this purpose, as elegantly and casually as possible. This was as if someone with a trumpet that has only 2 notes wants to play in an orchestra & is ardently waiting for the moment when he can again sound off one of them. Your photograph made a great impression on my old lady. While she was immersed in its contemplation, I added with deepest understanding: Oh, yes, she is a clever creature. I had already to endure quite a lot of teasing for this & for similar things, but I don't find this the least bit disagreeable. My broodings about radiation are starting to get on somewhat firmer ground & and I am curious myself whether something will come out of them.
##
Before I set about my day's work today I want to thank you for your friendly little card, after I had been waiting to see whether I couldn't find time to visit you. I wanted to go just today but I did not finish my work; however, I'll be sure to come a week from Sunday. (I think if I promise it, then it will go easier.) I wonder how the little Winteler home feels under your management? It probably thinks: Yes, indeed, Rosa is the only one who remains reliable and faithful to me! But all the same, in this it is a little bit mistaken. Little mother in law, for example, is not an activity to be sneezed at either: And your foster children, Pauli cat dog little bird, how good will they have it under such strict discipline and attention....And just across the street you have the prime fount of Aarau wisdom, which is tapped fresh from the barrel every day. Do you go there already? If so, then give my regards to Mr. Schuft nickname meaning "rogue" & also to Mr. Rennhart if the latter still remembers me. As long as we are at it, give also my kindest regards to your friend the little Miss Bride. Ask her also whether her sweetheart is sending her many sentimental little letters oh, that must be nice if you haven't asked her already, I am just fine. I work hard & feel very pleased & good in doing so. The days & weeks slip by just so, without my noticing it except toward the end of the month.....the old song with the old motif & and the many variations, a few of which you too probably know how to sing, Miss Housewife! But now I have to start with my work! 
##
I received a postcard from Mommy announcing that she and Papa will arrive here Friday evening & will immediately continue for Aarau, and that I should inform you of that. If it's at all feasible, I'll come to you at Whitsuntide. I am immensely delighted that once again I'll be able to pleasantly idle away such a day, because I am frightfully overburdened with work these days. Cordial greetings to everybody there, and especially to you from your Albert 48. 
##
Dear Miss! When your nice little card was lying on my table the other day, I felt very happy, and I would have felt much ashamed for not yet having responded to your kind invitation had I been able to write. It so happened that I injured my right hand rather seriously in the physics laboratory two weeks ago, so that the wound had to be closed by stitches at the clinic. Writing still causes me considerable trouble. But soon it will be fine again. I have not been to Aarau since, and neither have I been able to write there. In case you correspond with the Wintelers, please don't write them anything about that. You certainly seem to be in an enchanting little nest at present. I would love to help you kill time there in all sorts of pleasant ways. Unfortunately, my time slips by in everyday philistine work; but my hour of freedom is to strike soon and I am immensely happy about that. Starting with the first of August I'll be with my old lady and my sister in Mettmenstetten (line Zurich Affoltern Zug); you promised me to visit us there. A man's word is his bond which means that you must definitely come! In a week's time I'll be hiking on the Säntis, this will set off some marvelous clambering. Of course, my fiddle had to be laid aside. I am sure it wonders why it is never taken out of the black case, it probably thinks it has gotten a stepfather. How I miss the old friend through whom I say and sing to myself all that which I often do not at all admit to myself in barren thoughts but which, at best, makes me laugh when I see it in others... To my greatest regret, I will not be able to go and see the Winteler family for a long time, perhaps in September, if I don't go home to Milan, which I would have first to make plausible to my dear mama. Also, I may be doing scientific work with an Aarau gentleman during the second half of the vacation, and then many a musical hour will probably crop up for us. With the immodest plea that you write me a few lines when it happens to rain in Strada and you have nothing to do, and with affectionate greetings, I wish you a very enjoyable and good vacation. 
##
You girl small and fine 
What should I inscribe for you here? 
I could think of many a thing 
Including also a kiss On the tiny little mouth. 
If you're angry about it 
Do not start to cry 
The best punishment is—
To give me one too.
This little greeting is 
In remembrance of your rascally little friend
##
I bet you are surprised to see my hieroglyphs so soon again, knowing what a lazy letter writer I am. Here in Paradies I live a very quiet, nice, philistine life with my motherhen & sister, exactly the way the pious & the righteous of this world imagine Paradise to be. Meanwhile, I have already studied quite a bit of Helmholtz on atmospheric movements out of fear of you & also for my own pleasure, let me immediately add that I will reread the whole stuff with you. I admire the original, free mind of Helmh. more and more. You, poor soul, must now stuff your head full of gray theory. But I know well both you and your divine composure & know that you'll accomplish all that with a calm mind. Besides, you are at home and are being thoroughly pampered as is proper for a little daughter. To be sure, in our place in Zurich you are the mistress of the house, which is not bad either, & of what a marvelous household at that! When I was reading Helmholtz for the first time, it seemed inconceivable that you were not with me & now it's not much better. I find the collaboration very good & curative & also less desiccating. I find my mother & sister a bit narrow minded & philistine, despite all the sympathy I feel for them. It is strange how a way of life will gradually change us and all the nuances of our soul, so that the closest natural bonds of kinship are reduced to a friendship born of habit & that deep inside we become so incomprehensible to each other that we are unable to actively empathize with the other and feel what moves the other. Now you have just enough to decipher, considering how little time you can now devote to me. If you have time, write me again, but if not, I'll know the reason. 
##
Thank you for your friendly letter, which made me very happy, the more so since it gave me for the first time here the happy feeling one experiences when opening a personal letter. What a strange thing must be a girl's soul! Do you really believe that you could find permanent happiness through others, even if this be the one and only beloved man? I know this sort of animal personally, from my own experience as I am one of them myself. Not too much should be expected from them, this I know quite exactly. Today we are sullen, tomorrow high spirited, after tomorrow cold, then again irritated and half sick of life and so it goes but I have almost forgotten the unfaithfulness & ingratitude & selfishness, things in which almost all of us do significantly better than the good girls...
In fact, I should have spoken only for myself were it not for the sad comfort that most of the others are basically not any different. Thank you for asking so kindly about my hand, which is now completely cured. I only wanted that you do not mention anything about it to the Wintelers so that they would not worry about me, otherwise I do not want to keep anything secret from them. You may tell them all about it afterwards and also give them my best regards. It was wonderful on the Säntis. I was up there twice in 4 days. The hike is extremely rewarding and nothing less than difficult. There is nothing nicer for such a stay at home as myself than to roam in nature for a change, and open himself to whatever happens to be offered to his eyes instead of always deciding himself what should occupy the mind. I now feel like a harassed housewife on vacation who normally has to prepare the daily menu herself but is now very amiably fed without end in a hotel. I share your pain that your life at home, with all its prose, must feel even more bitter after the beautiful vacation. At all events, I congratulate you on your decision to go abroad. Every girl should do that if she has the strength to do it. I know already now about one job in Italy, which has some good points as far as you are concerned, and, of course, also some bad points, as everything in the world. So, out with it, I will describe to you everything as objectively as I can. You know my cousin Robert Koch. His mother needs a governess for her only daughter (7 years old). My aunt is a woman of natural intelligence, truthful, superficially educated, just, vain, domineering, but also dispassionate and communicative. She expects that people behave properly toward her, but her behavior is also thoroughly correct. But she is rather tactless and insensitive. She is the mistress and the master of the house. The food is good she is a capable housewife. You would thus have to take care only of the child, a really intelligent, good child, even though a bit spoiled. They live in a beautiful house in Genoa in any case, all bodily needs are taken care of. You will also get to know the city and the country. Really, nothing is more important to my aunt than the education of her children. I cannot tell you anything about the salary: you should write me about that since I am ignorant in those matters. You only have to come to terms with my aunt the others have no say. Please write me pretty soon about the particulars, but also with a personal little appendix for me, please.
##
Many thanks for your little letter, to which I would have replied by now had I not gone with our landlord on a walking tour in the mountains, which was, by the way, quite delightful (Zug Einsiedeln Züricher Obersee). I hope that you received my first little letter, even though it did not contain much of importance, because otherwise you would be certain to bear a bitter grudge against me & think that I am a faithless idler. The vacation is passing in blissful peace and quiet, so that it's studying that represents a change to me, and not loafing, as we are used to from our household. And you, good so are writing me that the cramming diet for the examination does you some good, I like that. You are really great & have much vitality & health in your small little body. I returned the Helmholtz volume and am at present studying again in depth Hertz's propagation of electric force. The reason for it was that I didn't understand Helmholtz's treatise on the principle of least action in electrodynamics. I am more and more convinced that the electrodynamics of moving bodies, as presented today, is not correct, and that it should be possible to present it in a simpler way. The introduction of the term "ether" into the theories of electricity led to the notion of a medium of whose motion one can speak without being able, I believe, to associate a physical meaning with this statement. I think that the electric forces can be directly defined only for empty space, which is also emphasized by Hertz. Further, electric currents will have to be conceived of not, as "the vanishing of electric polarization in time" but as motion of true electric masses whose physical reality seems to be confirmed by the electrochemical equivalents. Mathematically, they are then always to be conceived of in the form dX dX dY dZ dy dz . Electrodynamics would then be the theory of the motion of moving electricities and magnetisms in empty space: which of the two conceptions must be chosen will have to be revealed by radiation experiments. By the way, I had no news so far from Rector Wüst. will write him shortly. Here in Paradies it is continuously very lovely, particularly because we have wonderful weather. However, we always have disagreable visits from Mama's acquaintances, whose dull witted chatter I usually escape by slipping away if we are not just having a meal. Finally, there is also my aunt from Genoa, a veritable monster of arrogance & dull witted formalism. All the same, I enjoy each and every day of my vacation at this charming and quiet little place. If only you would be again with me a little! We both understand each other's black souls so well & also drinking coffeee & eating sausages etc.... I I also almost believe that the whole story regarding you & Mama existed only in my imagination. It probably wouldn't even have occurred to you. Anyhow, write me here the next time. You must have misunderstood me then. I am always delighted with your little notes; send me some again soon.
##
I am finally able to write to you after receiving your dear little letter, which I would have liked best of all to answer the very first day. But it had to be forwarded to Aarau, where it is too charming & one always gets pestered in such a lovely way that it is impossible to write. You poor thing must now be cramming really awfully! If only I could help you a bit, be it merely to bring you some variety, or be it in the studies, or be it as Johann with all the lovely trifles that go with that. But now this will soon be behind you & then you can again count one more victory in life & you'll get a significant little piece of white paper. I couldn't take the physics notebook to your pad yesterday, when I was in Zurich, because there wasn't enough time for that. But don't sulk because of this, little witch! When you come to Zurich, just come to my pad & take whatever you like & if you cannot find something that should be there, just ask Mrs. Markwalder. (She knows everything?). The day after tomorrow I am going with my mother to Milan, and I won't be back in "our" place in Zurich before the start of the semester. I would like so much to try to make the examination time more pleasant for you in Zurich if this wouldn't cause very understandable pain to my parents. At present I'll be completely bookless for a week, since all libraries are now being inventoried, but within a week I can have the municipal library send me books by Helmholtz Boltzmann & Mach to Milan. But so that you wouldn't frown and worry, I give you my solemn promise that I'll go over everything with you. I think we should once stay in Zurich during vacation time, so as to lead our semester life without lectures in ease and comfort for once, this must really be quite nice. A good idea occurred to me in Aarau about a way of investigating how the bodies' relative motion with respect to the luminiferous ether affects the velocity of propagation of light in transparent bodies. Also a theory on this matter occurred to me, which seems to me to be highly probable. But enough of that! Your poor little head is full enough of different people's hobby horses that you had to ride. This being the case, I shouldn't march in mine as well. I don't know what else to say, except that you needn't let this little bit of examination worry you. This is a trifle for you especially with such harmless competitors.  
##
Since everything is already packed, I am using this little piece of paper to enclose a little greeting. I have already given my aunt a plausible explanation about your having accepted another position, and she now has the choice between the governess from Zofingen you recommended and a young woman from Zurich whose name by chance is also Martha Müller. The latter will come to Aunt this afternoon for an interview. At any event, I'll be able to send an answer to your friend, though not a definitive one. In the meantime I had a few verbal battles with the ladies. Tomorrow, then, follows the separation when we return home. I wish you all the luck in your future position, & most of all, I wish you luck in love, which for you girls is always the most important thing (but for us boys too). Now I'll have to apply myself once again to my domestic duties as the pillar of the housewives & society ladies.
##
Since everybody except myself is now busy packing for our departure tomorrow, I happen to have a free hour or so, which seems just made for my writing you another little letter. My heartfelt thanks for all the love you have given me as usual, in spite of the great distress that befell you through my fault. If only the letter in question did some good! Here I found everything in best order. Instead of a severe lecture, I got only a few maternal looks that could have passed for it. But now everything is forgotten again, as I got used to Aunt's whims, which, after all, are childish, and are in fact only the result of great pampering. One only has to treat such folks properly, and then one can do as one likes & does not give them a headache. I had a very lively conversation with Professor Haab and very animatedly discussed with him the topic suggested by you. In most praiseworthy modesty he took himself as an example & then talked much about pearls that had been cast before swine & thus had found their way to oblivion. He spoke about a hoped for change, but also about its difficulties. But don't tell him anything about that, he would find it very painful that such a young and inexperienced man interferes in his internal affairs. Actually, I would have remained completely passive during the conversation if his amiable nature had not made me open my mouth. Please ask the Professor to give my kindest regards to Mr. Wüst, I think I forgot to do it. In addition to the governess recommended by Miss Julia, Aunt has also in prospect a woman of the same name from Zurich. Both are called Martha Müller. The woman from Zurich is an acquaintance of Mrs. Markwalder & will arrive here this afternoon. In any case, I will see to it that the governess from Zofingen has an answer written to her already today, so that her hands would not be tied. The reporting of sheer facts has made my letter quite dry, I hope that from Milan I'll be able to have this one followed by a better one, which will then be destined for you. Pauli should not be angry about the postcard from my sister. She wouldn't have allowed herself this teasing had I not been behind it.
##
You are such a splendid girl for writing me so nicely despite all your hard and taxing work. But you should also know that your letters always make me so happy that everybody teases me for it. You must have swallowed a lot of book dust, poor thing, but soon it will be behind you I really feel with you. I too have done much bookworming & puzzling out, which was in part very interesting. I also wrote to Professor Wien in Aachen about the paper on the relative motion of the luminiferous ether against ponderable matter, which the "Principal" treated in such a stepmotherly fashion. I read a very interesting paper published by this man on the same topic in 1898. He will write me via Polytechnikum (when it's for certain!). If you see there a letter addressed to me, you may take it and open it. I'll be back "home" about the 15th. I look forward to it with great joy, because our place is still the nicest and coziest after all. Maya is going to Aarau chiefly because we know a family there very well and because life is less expensive there; we must keep that very much in mind. Mrs. Markwalder feels herself bound to.... She is an angel of presentiment. I have already written to her that I agree & have given her permission to assign the room in whichever way. I would move to somewhere in the Plattenstrasse, but not into your house for the sake of people's tongues. I would move to the Zürichberg if it would not be so far away from "us." By the time you receive my letter, the Fiedlering will probably be already behind you I think so much about it. Everything will go all right your hard little head guarantees me that. If only I could peep through the keyhole! When one is taking such an examination, one feels so responsible for everything one thinks and does as if one were in a penal institution. Isn't it so? At this time I was laughing so much with Grossmann about these things but an uninvolved party could have commented, "laughing on the outside, cracking in the inside." My sister will probably not stop in Zurich at all; rather, I shall accompany her to Aarau, but I shall not stay there beyond that. Here I again feel rather uncomfortable, because the climate does not agree with me at all & because of the lack of some definite work I brood too much in brief, I see & feel that I am not under your beneficient thumb, which otherwise keeps me within bounds. Neuweiler is the black one that always drinks milk. It also has eyeglasses and very little fat. You don't have to be afraid at all that I'll be going to Aarau very often now. Because the critical little daughter is coming home, with whom I fell so terribly in love 4 years ago. To be sure, I feel otherwise very safe in my high castle Peace of Mind. But if I saw the girl again a few times, I would surely get crazy again, I am aware of that & fear it like fire. Once I am back in Zurich, we shall immediately climb the Utliberg. There we can have fun unpacking our memories of Säntis; I picture it again to myself in such gay colors. And then we will start immediately with Helmholtz's electromagnetic theory of light, which 1) out of fear 2) because I did not have it, I still have not read. 
##
Now, you are a fine one! It's already the 4th day that she has been sitting very cozily at the examination & has not yet uttered a single word to her good colleague and coffee guzzling pal. Isn't that horrible? I shall compose a fire and brimstone sermon and give it to you in person next Monday, and early in the morning at that. And if the maid says that you have left & I see your polished little boots in front of the door, which seems to be happening from time to time then I'll simply wait a little or I'll get a shave. Sunday I am taking my sister to Aarau & the very same day I'll show up in Zurich at the place of my beloved ex landlady, who simply has not responded to a postcard in which I dared to ask her whether it is within her "inscrutable providence" to billet me somewhere else. Thus I, poor postal parcel, must wait until I get enlightened about the place of my destination. If I think how you are now buried in work, my anger caused by your non writing melts away like wax. You poor creature, you in fact have it much harder than I had it the last year because you are so alone! But stop I already see you smile over my consolation job & think: Such a matter is of little concern to a Dockerl; it knows itself what it wants and can & has it already demonstrated several times. But now something nicer I have in mind our household, of course. It will again become lovely there. I am bringing a few marvelous delicacies from Mama, who has also promised to send us frequently something to the household: directly to Plattenstr. 50. In the meantime, do get Helmholtz's electromagnetic theory of light! I have already developed quite a hunger for it. I have been studying here a lot & have completed my considerations about the study of the basic laws of thermoelectricity. I have also devised a method of great simplicity, which permits one to decide whether the latent heat in metals is to be reduced to the motion of ponderable matter or of electricity, i.e., whether an electrically charged body has a different specific heat than an uncharged one. All these questions are connected with the analysis of the thermoelement. The methods are very simple to carry out & do not require any equipment that is not readily available to us. But that's enough for today, otherwise my old folks are going to tease me for my writing so much without a reply.

I am taking the liberty to transmit to you, enclosed, my father's written authorization regarding my acquisition of Swiss cantonal and municipal citizenship, and am using this opportunity to respectfully request an early and favorable decision on my application. 
##
Highly esteemed Mr. City President! Highly esteemed Messrs. City Councilors! The undersigned, ALBERT EINSTEIN, stud. math. at the Federal Polytechnikum, born on 14 March 1879, from Ulm, Württemberg, herewith respectfully requests that on payment of the legal fee you admit him to the Citizens' Federation of the City of Zurich. Domiciled in Zurich since 29 October 1896, I have always devoted myself to studies and believe that in no manner have I given grounds for any conclusions that could be an obstacle to the granting of the citizenship. I take the liberty of attaching to my request the approval of the Federal Council, required by municipal law for the acquisition of Swiss cantonal and municipal citizenship, and will gladly provide any further information.

Because I am writing in my bed This just won't be so terribly neat! But never mind, just go on scrawling, For Doxerl is interested in it all the same!... So the day before yesterday I arrived, as planned, with the Terrible Aunt at Sarnen, where Mama, Maya, and a carriage were waiting for us. Thereupon I got smothered with kisses. Then we drove off; but soon Maya and I got off to stroll a little bit. On that occasion Maya told me that she did not dare to report anything about the "Dockerl affair," and she also asked me to "spare" mama which means not to blurt out everything. We come home, I into Mama's room (just the two of us). First I have to tell her about the examination, then she asks me quite innocently: "So, what will become of Dockerl?" "My wife," say I, equally innocently, but prepared for a real "scene." This then ensued immediately. Mama threw herself on the bed, buried her head in the pillow, and cried like a child. After she had recovered from the initial shock, she immediately switched to a desperate offensive, "You are ruining your future and blocking your path through life". "That woman cannot gain entrance to a decent family." "If she gets a child, you'll be in a pretty mess." At this last outburst, which had been preceded by several others, my patience finally gave out. I rejected the suspicion that we had been living in sin with all my might, scolded properly & was just ready to leave the room, when Mama's friend Mrs. Bär entered the room, a small, lively little woman full of life, such a sort of hen of the nicest kind. Thereupon we immediately started to talk with the greatest eagerness about the weather, new spa guests, ill behaved children, etc. Then we went to eat, after that we played some music. When we said "good night" to each other in private, the same story started again, but "piu piano." Next day things were already better, and this, as she herself said, for the following reason: "If they have not yet had intimate relations (so much dreaded by her) and will wait so long, then ways and means will surely be found." Only what is most terrible for her is that we want to stay together forever. Her attempts at converting me were based on speeches like: "She is a book like you but you ought to have a wife." "When you'll be 30, she'll be an old hag," etc. But as she sees that in the meanwhile she is accomplishing nothing except to make me angry, she has given up the "treatment" for the time being. Life and people here are hopelessly dull & I perfectly understand the dissatisfaction of Maya, who is again mad with joy as she looks forward to Aarau. Each meal lasts 1 hour and more; you can imagine what a hellish torture that is to me. Since, furthermore, the weather is bad, in my desperation I fled to Kirchhoff. Besides those already mentioned, our constant hangers on include my aunt, the Englishwoman, the contessa with her daughter, who is as beautiful as she is stupid and cold. For Mama's sake I must flatter all of them & play music otherwise she is offended, all the more so as she is doubly sensitive because of the affair. If only I could be soon again with you in Zurich, my little sweetheart!

How glad I am to know that by now you are home with your good old lady, who is again marvelously fattening up my little Doxerl, so that she will rest again in my arms plump as a dumpling and healthy and cheerful, one fancies in the beloved oxistant's arms; even though, in fact, I have no news yet from Zurich, the high spirits produced by the carefree life and good food are giving me confidence. I think I have not been able to kiss you for a whole month and I thoroughly long after you. Such a nimble, active thing like my Doxerl with her dexterous hands cannot be found in the entire ant hill of the hotel. The mama in law has already made peace with me, more or less & is gradually getting reconciled to the unavoidable. She has already regained her good cheer. I have also written to Papa; he announced a separate letter to me; he too will certainly resist at first, but all this is of no importance. I long terribly for a letter from my beloved witch. I can hardly grasp that we will be separated for so much longer only now do I see how frightfully much I love you! Indulge yourself thoroughly, so that you'll become a blossoming little sweetheart and wild like a street urchin. Melchthal is a wonderful little stream valley formed by mountains that are tall but not covered by glaciers. Our hotel in particular is an outstanding feeding establishment; but I do not feel comfortable in this loafing among these people gone soft. Especially when I see the decked out lazy women who are always disgruntled about something, I think proudly : Johonnesl, your Doxerl is a maiden of a totally different kind. Brandenberger is also here together with bride, a young woman from Zurich whom I like very much. The two are visibly in a state of bliss a very lovely little couple. I was yesterday with Maya on a rather high mountain, where we found many edelweiss. We had a marvelous view, especially of the gigantic firn fields of the Titlis. Toward mid August we shall go to Papa in Italy, to spend also some time in a more southerly location. Before that, I shall also go to Zurich to see about my job. I have still not heard from Ehrat either. As it rains much, I have already studied a lot, mainly the notorious investigations on the motion of a rigid body by Kirchhoff. I marvel at this great piece of work again and again. My nerves have calmed down so much that I again study with bliss. 
##
Your first dear little letter from the homeland arrived yesterday First I read your letter in the quiet little chamber, then twice more & then for a long time I kept reading between the lines with great delight & then I slid it grinning in the pocket. The "Mama in Law" is very congenial & and does not mention the "delicate subject," all the more so because my happy cheerful mood, my popularity among the guests & my "musical successes" are balm on her wounded mother in law's heart, so that the atmosphere is by now outright cozy. But our correspondence, dear sweetheart, seems to be under an evil spell, seeing that you had not received my letter at the time you mailed yours. This is the 3d one I am sending you. I have not yet received a report from Zurich. I assume I will have to look out for my matter myself. In view of Ehrat's conscientiousness, the only thing I can think of is that his matter is still up in the air. 
##
Take a thorough rest, sweetheart, you can do enough wonderful studying with your Johonnesl later on. But now rest and enjoy your carefree life. Papa has now also written me a sermonizing letter for the time being, but he promised me that the main thing will follow orally, to which I am most dutifully looking forward to. I can understand my old folks quite well. They consider a wife as the man's luxury, which he can only allow himself once he makes a comfortable living. However, I have a very low opinion of such an attitude toward the relationship between man and woman because according to it, a wife and a whore differ only insofar as the former is able to extort a contract for life from the husband, due to her more favorable life circumstances. Such a view is the natural consequence of the fact that with my parents, as with most people, the senses exert a direct mastery over the feelings, while with us, by virtue of the happy circumstances under which we are living, the enjoyment of life is infinitely broadened. But we must not forget how many existences of the first kind it takes to make this possible for us; because in the social evolution of humankind the former are a far more important constituent. Hunger and love are and remain such important mainsprings of life that almost everything can be explained by them, neglecting the other leitmotifs. I am therefore trying to spare my parents, without giving up anything I consider to be good and that is you, my dear sweetheart! If you haven't yet told anything to your family, don't do it! I think that this is better for all parties concerned. Otherwise they might start having the same unnecessary worries and qualms as my family. But after all, you are wise and know them, and know better what you have to do. When I do not have you, I feel as if I were not whole. When I am sitting, I would like to walk; when I am walking, I look forward to being at home, when I amuse myself, I would like to study, and when I am studying, I feel a lack of contemplativeness and repose & when I go to bed, I am not satisfied with how I passed the day. 
##
You are surprised, aren't you, that I have popped up here again! But I am using the first possible excuse to get out from the boring environment, even though my mother made it her duty to observe the deepest silence about the "affair." She behaved as if nothing had happened, handed me your letters in person, did not notice when I was writing to you to put it briefly, she gave up the open battle & probably will only fire off the philistine cannons jointly with Papa. The latter promised me in his last letter that he will visit Venice with me, because our power plants are not far from there. I would also like to get initiated a little into administration so that I could take Papa's place in case of emergency. He too does not mention you any longer. I would have done better, sweetheart, had we kept everything to ourselves and had I put off the old folks. But no harm has been done, my dear sweetheart, Papa and Mama are very phlegmatic people and have less stubbornness in their whole body than I have in my little finger. Just as my old Zurich makes me feel at home, so do I miss you, my dear little "right hand." I can go wherever I want but I do not belong anywhere and I miss the two little arms and the glowing little girl full of tenderness and kisses. How sorry I felt for the Catholic clergymen who were in Melchthall! The measurements of my tender little feet I'll send you another time, now don't you start wriggling again. In return, however, you'll get a big kiss for your hen like eagerness! But now, as to the excuse. On the evening of the day before yesterday I received a postcard from Ehrat, in which he writes that he proposed me for a temporary position with the insurance office in which he is working at present. One gets 8 fr per day & has 8 hours of idiotic drudgery. But I declined, believing that I could use the vacation better. One must shun such stultifying affairs. I am remaining here to see how the matter will develop and finally to straighten out my "business and political" affairs. It seems that Ehrat's competition also includes Matter, whose election would yield me the position with Hurwitz. So, courage, little witch! I can't wait for the moment when I'll be able to hug you and press you and live with you again. And cheerfully we will go at it and work and have heaps of money. And if the next spring is beautiful, we will get flowers in Melchthal.

Once again a few lazy and dull days flitted past my sleepy eyes, you know, such days on which one gets up late because one cannot think of anything proper to do, then goes out until the room has been made up, then studies for a few hours until one gets too tired. Then one hangs around and looks halfheartedly forward to the meal, languidly meditating about highly important philosophical questions & whistling a little while doing so...... How was I able to live alone before, my little everything. Without you I lack self confidence, pleasure in work, pleasure in living in short, without you my life is no life. I was even making visits in order to distract myself. For example, I called on Mrs. Markwalder, who still shows the same apathetic languid amiability & sees everything in an undefinable daze; how lucky that I do not lodge any longer with her. I have also visited Jungferli the little virgin, who is still one of the nicest and liveliest persons we know here. She is now leaving for good; she is moving to a small town in the Thurgau. I also visited your landlady. She said that your suitcase had gone a long time ago. She asked whether you perhaps want to keep the room, she would then make a special arrangement. But I turned this down (the tyrant! you'll probably think). But I will not grant you leave beyond the first days of October that is just long enough. I am leaving Saturday for Italy to partake at my father's in the pleasures of the "holy sacrament"; but the brave Swabian is not afraid. I hope I will not become so moldy when I grow old, then it'll be alright. Your old folks are proof that one can also be different they must be splendid people. Just don't tell them too much about me, otherwise they too might get scared. Had I been smarter, I would have kept my mouth shut. Why did I not take better to heart my motto omnes tractandi sunt? But never mind, this will make it all the more pleasant when we will again have each other in Zurich and will enlarge our wisdom while having some fragrant coffee! That your mommy feeds you well and your sister teases you mightily is alright & that you are longing for me makes me proud! Don't study hard when your books have arrived, get rested instead, so you'll become again the old street urchin. There is only a single thing that I do wish & request from you, and that is that you feel well. But if this is not the case, I'll spank you. Ehrat still does not have the position in Frauenfeld. He is in competition with Matter. But in any case, one of the two will get it. Thus, I am taken care of under all circumstances. I could have had a position in life insurance for 3 weeks for 8 fr. per day, but I declined because I thought that I could use my vacations better by studying something proper & then in Italy learning the trade of my father. After all, it could happen that he suddenly fell ill or would be otherwise engaged & he has nobody at his disposal. How lovely it will be next year!

Schnadahüpfl a humorous improvised four line dialect verse, literally tailor hop: O my! the Johonzel, He is totally crazy. He was thinking about his Doxerl And he squeezed his pillow.  When my sweetheart is sulking, I become soft as a rag, But she only shrugs her shoulders And says: I don't care. My old folks they think, This is a stupid thing... But they don't say anything, Lest they'd get whacked over their head.
The little beak of my Doxerl I would like to hear it And after that cheerfully Shut it off with mine... So, sweetheart, it's already two days that I am here with my old folks and quite pleased with them. There is no "treatment" in sight. I have never talked about you in particular, but I have often dropped your name here and there. As I see it, they have nothing against our relationship, evidently because they do not think any longer that we are ruining our future. Besides, they also know that I won't let myself be influenced. If I don't provoke them, everything will take its jolly course we a cheerful lively couple and they satisfied and pleased with that. Oh, how happy I will be when I can clasp you to my heart again! This will be in the first days of October! But now you should have it nice, my only sweet little woman. I haven't yet heard anything about the "position." But I am taking it easy. If I don't get any, the "whole family" will simply have to give private lessons. Thanks to the good domestic feed and the cheerful disposition of my parents, my optimism has again grown immensely. My father has become a completely different man now that he no longer has to worry about money. That all the dark clouds have vanished you can also see from the fact that he is taking a trip to Venice with me after we have visited his power plants together. I would like to kiss you out of pleasure and delight, my little dear angel. But you have not written to me for a long time, you wild witch! Are you afraid it will "miss its target" or are you furious, you little rascal? Or do you just want to make me curious and hungry? Or can it be that you are afraid of sisterly jokes? The child makes herself hard to get What does he think about that? It is devoted, after all, with all its fibers To its lad. But because you are such a wild little rascal, I am stopping now, furious like the devil!

Today I received a registered letter from you, by which I can tell that you fear it may fall into somebody else's hands. No, sweetheart, I got all your letters on time, and also the money long ago in Melchthal. You can always write to me exactly the way you feel, because for my parents to take away a letter would be as unwise as it is useless. By the way, you don't have to be afraid of something like that, if for no other reason than because I am sure that my parents are incapable of acting in such a way. I have put Mama to the test. My parents are very distressed about my love for you, Mama often cries bitterly & I am not given a single undisturbed moment here. My parents mourn for me almost as if I had died. Again and again they wail to me that I brought disaster upon myself by my promise to you, that they believe that you are not healthy........ oh, Doxerl, this is enough to drive one crazy! You wouldn't believe.how I suffer when I see how both of them love me and are so disconsolate as if I had committed the greatest crime & not done what my heart and my conscience irresistibly prompted me to do. If only they would know you! But they are as if bewitched & think that this is what I am. On Saturday I am going on the trip with Papa, to Venice too. I was so sad, that I didn't want to go with him; but this alarmed them so terribly that I got quite scared. I'll only be able to recover from this vacation gradually in your arms there are worse things in life than an exam. Now I know it. This is worse than the difficulties in the world. My only distraction is studying, which I am now doing with twice as much love & and my only hope is you, my dear faithful soul. Without the thought of you I would not want to live any longer in this sorry human crowd. But possessing you makes me proud & your love makes me happy. I will be doubly happy when I can press you to my heart again and see your loving eyes which shine for me alone, and kiss your dear mouth, which trembled in bliss for me alone. Thank God that August crept past. Only 4 more weeks, and then we are united again and can live to please each other. But then I'll not let you go so soon again! I am spending many evenings here at Michele's. I like him very much because of his sharp mind and his simplicity, & also Anna and, especially, the little brat. His house is simple and cozy, even though the details show some lack of taste. Kissing you from the bottom of his heart, your Sweetheart Friday. So, tomorrow we are leaving for the trip, but we will be back in a week, so just keep sending me your little letters. Luigi Ansbacher might come to visit us. For the investigation of the Thomson effect I have again resorted to another method, which has some similarities with yours for the determination of the dependence of K on T & which indeed presupposes such an investigation. If only we could already start tomorrow! With Weber we must try to get on good terms at all costs, because his laboratory is the best and the best equipped.

3/4 of the stupid time is now over, soon I'll be again with my sweetheart and kiss it, hug it, brew coffee, scold work laugh stroll chat...+ ad infinit.! This will again be a cheerful year, will it not? I have already declared that I am staying with you for Christmas. I cannot wait to have you again, my all, my little beast, my street urchin, my little brat. Now that I think of you, I just believe that I do not want to make you angry & tease you ever again, but want to be always like an angel! Oh, lovely illusion! But you love me, don't you, even if I am again the old scoundrel full of whims and devilries, and as moody as always! I don't know whether I have been writing you these days as regularly as usual. But don't make angry faces because of that my aunt is visiting here (the praised one from Genoa) with her little daughter, a sadly spoiled brat. So I have no room whatever where I can be alone to write to you. But if I write in front of my parents, they think that I am doing it to spite them. By the way, they are very nice to me, especially Papa; they seem to have reconciled themselves to the inevitable. Both of them will be very fond of you once they get to know you. Now I am very glad that I told everything. They should be glad too, because nowhere in the world would I bee able to find a better one than you, now, when I see other people, I recognize this more than ever. But I also value you & love you the way you deserve. Even my work seems to me pointless and unnecessary if I am not telling myself that you are happy with what I am and what I do. And I am finally sending you the sketch of my gigantic little foot, which I so often forgot to send you. Johannsel's foot! accompanied by a sketch. Since you have such a huge imagination & are used to astronomical distances, I believe that the accompanying work of art will suffice. I am glad that you stroll around so much & have gotten a good sunburn how am I going to press my little Negro girl to me! I am also looking forward very much to our new studies. You must now continue with your investigation how proud I will be when maybe I'll have a little doctor for a sweetheart while I am myself still a totally ordinary man. But I already mentioned in my last letter, didn't I, that Matter got the position in Frauenfeld & that consequently I shall probably advance to Hurwitz's servant with God's help (of course because he is a man). Doesn't matter, Toxerlin, at least it's yours. The Boltzmann is magnificent. I have almost finished it. He is a masterly expounder. I am firmly convinced that the principles of the theory are right, which means that I am convinced that in the case of gases we are really dealing with discrete mass points of definite finite size, which are moving according to certain conditions. Boltzmann very correctly emphasizes that the hypothetical forces between the molecules are not an essential component of the theory, as the whole energy is of the kinetic kind. This is a step forward in the dynamic explanation of physical phenomena. Do you also know already that for some time I have been shaving myself, and that with great success? You'll see, Toxerline. I can always do it while you are brewing the coffee after lunch, so as not to continue studying as usually do, while the poor Doxerl of course has to cook and the lazy Johanzel never budges once he has quickly carried out the order "grind this."

Thank you for your kind little letter with the nice dreams of the future, the noodles & the Xantippe ing, and the plan to bring along your fat little sister into our "European culture." So that she would get a truly high opinion of it & be really impressed by us, I have already bought two little coffee spoons for our household. How lovely it will be again when I'll be able to press you to myself again, my little street urchin, my little verandah, my everything! Imagine, tomorrow morning I am again running away to the mountains I'll be climbing a mountain near Lago Maggiore & I shall then visit Isola Bella. How wonderful it would be if Madame Federico Maier could also be there to take a look at all that splendor and then, during the quiet evening, sweetly and nicely chase away his peculiar notions, don't you think so, sweet Miez! How I am going to bite you and hug you once I'll have you again and now it will have to wait more than 3 weeks because of the stupid little goiter. How are things in that respect ? On 1 October I am probably going to Zurich, to talk personally with Hurwitz about the position. This is better than writing. I should look around for sources of income for you? I think I will look around for private lessons, which you possibly could take over. Or do you have also something else in mind? Write me about that! However things turn out, we are getting the most delightful life from in? the world. Beautiful work and together and what's more, we both are now our own bosses & are standing on our own feet & can enjoy our youth to the hilt. Who could have it better? And when we have saved enough money, we shall buy bikes and go on a biking trip every few weeks. Your dear sister, whom I already know through her lively little letters, will surely like it here with us I do not have to tell you that she is most welcome, the cheerful, obstinate thing. In a playful moment I wrote yesterday a letter to a former teacher of mine in Munich, of whom I was especially fond, I'll see whether he is going to answer it. By now I have studied the entire Boltzmann and a part of spherical harmonics, in which I have now even got quite interested. Beggars can't be choosers... Luigi Ansbacher, about whom we are always teasing Maja, is going to arrive in a few days I am looking forward to playing music with him. I have also thought about the fact that my little sweetheart will be homeless when she comes to Zurich. Unfortunately, Mrs. Hägi no longer has room in her new apartment. But I will look around for something. Perhaps I might just as well hunt for a room for the two of you. If only I were not afraid of the responsibility because my little brat is very capricious. Poor little Helen has now fallen for him after all, due to his laudable persistence now her fine spirit will suffocate in his fat a sad psychological prophecy. It's really a pity for her. Moreover, I think that in a short time he will be the same scoundrel he used to be. Something like that doesn't disappear easily. The "groom" has thus become a real "husband"? You see, real miracles do happen in our skeptical age too!

 My friend Ehrat has written to me that Dr. Matter, who has been your assistant until now, has obtained a position as a Gymnasium teacher in Frauenfeld. I am therefore taking the liberty to inquire respectfully whether I have a chance of becoming your assistant. I would not have taken the liberty of troubling you with such an inquiry during vacations were it not for the fact that the granting of citizenship in Zurich, for which I have applied, has been made conditional upon my proving that I have a permanent job.
##
Thank you for your kind letter. It made me very happy to learn that I have a chance of getting the position. Since lack of time prevented my taking part in the mathematics seminar, and no opportunity was offered for seminar exercises in theoretical and experimental physics, there is nothing in my favor except the fact that I attended most of the lectures offered. I think I should therefore also mention that I occupied myself mainly with analytical mechanics and theoretical physics during my university years. 
##
Soon I will really have a bad conscience for not having written to you frequently enough lately, even though I wouldn't be able to say exactly when it was that I wrote to you the last time. In fact, I shouldn't make you angry anymore, now that we are to see each other again so soon, because of the scolding, but he is just dumb, your Johannsel. I am glad that your sister will be coming after all. We will cure her homesickness & other whims, even though I cannot do it in Serbian. So, the sledging has made the things turn out all right. There is nothing like a female! (Of course, as a little natural scientist, you are always excepted in such considerations.) I have now prolonged my stay here until Sunday morning, because now I feel quite good here. Even though with hesitation and grudgingly, my old folks withdrew from the fight about Dockerl when they saw that they must lose. Now they rejoice in the good weather & save me from any further debates. Hurwitz has not yet written anything further, but I have hardly any doubts. Michele has already noticed that I like you, because, even though I didn't tell him almost anything about you, he said, when I told him that I must now go to Zurich again: "He surely wants to go to his woman colleague, what else would draw him to Zurich?" I replied, "But unfortunately she is not yet there." I prodded him very much to become a Dozent university lecturer, but I doubt very much that he'll do it. He simply doesn't want to let himself and his family be supported by his father, this is after all quite natural. What a waste of his truly outstanding intelligence. In physical chemistry I am now quite well versed. I am delighted by the accomplishments attained in this field in the last 30 years. You will enjoy it when we'll go over it together. The physical methods of investigation employed are also very interesting. The grandest of all is the theory of ions, which has splendidly proved itself in the most diverse areas. The results on capillarity, which I recently found in Zurich, seem to be totally new despite their simplicity. When we come to Zurich, we shall seek to get empirical material on the subject through Kleiner. If a law of nature emerges from this, we will send it to Wiedemann's Annalen. At present the ex groom Fritz Winteler is visiting with Anna; he is a disgusting shop talker & will again be Assistent in Darmstadt. You too don't like the philistine life any longer, don't you?! He who tasted freedom cannot stand the chains any longer. How lucky I am to have found in you a creature who is my equal, who is as strong and independent as I am myself! Except with you, I feel alone with everybody.

So, it happened at last! I congratulate you cordially on your good fortune and your decision, and wish you all the bliss a girl dreams about. And may my card readings not come true, needless to say; rather, you shall become a nimble, capable little housewife, for his happiness and as an example to all the world. One of these days, if God does not will it differently, I'll peep into your little nest and with the conscientiousness of an old aunt I'll check out everything to my satisfaction and I'll let my critical eyes dart in all directions. My Dockerl arrived here yesterday together with her sister, so that I hang out at her place all day long, as always. Neither of us two has gotten a job and we support ourselves by private lessons  when we can pick up some, which is still very questionable. Is this not a journeyman's or even a gypsy's life? But I believe that we'll remain cheerful in it as ever. I hope that you will both come again to Zurich, so that the old friendship does not become rusty. Also, I would very much like to see what sort of figure you cut as "the better half." How you will be envied by your spinster college friends!



I'll not vent on you my impotent resentment over not getting to read Dockerl's letter to you; I'll rather rejoice a little with you in your new happiness. One can really rejoice in seeing you two in the photograph, and so we did. Your little sister has sent us the photograph, and a nice letter to go with it...but when will we see the originals? Very soon in Zurich, I hope. But what do you say to our separation? The lass cried because the lad must split but we thought we won't grumble about it! Thus we are staying together, the same as before, at any rate until Easter and also thereafter..... To you I wish all the happiness, to your operated sister a good recovery, and to ourselves another friendly letter from you soon.

Last summer I completed my studies at the mathematical physical department of the Zurich Polytechnikum, and since I would like to expand and in some ways complete the knowledge which I acquired by attending lectures, studying the classics, and working in the physical laboratory, but am totally lacking the necessary means, I am taking the liberty of asking you whether you might need an assistant. A few days ago, there appeared in Wiedemann's Annalen a short paper of mine titled "Theoretische Folgerungen aus den Kapillaritätserscheinungen" "Theoretical conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity." I would appreciate if you could drop me a few lines and let me know about my prospects of getting such a position now or possibly next autumn. 
##
Because your work on general chemistry inspired me to write the enclosed article, I am taking the liberty of sending you a copy of it. On this occasion permit me also to inquire whether you might have use for a mathematical physicist familiar with absolute measurements. If I permit myself to make such an inquiry, it is only because I am without means, and only a position of this kind would offer me the possibility of additional education.
##
I got a sign of life from you so soon, already on the first day. This is an ugly story with Riecke; I have more or less given up the position for lost. I can hardly believe that Weber would let such a good opportunity pass without doing some mischief. Following your advice, love, I wrote to Weber so that he should at least know that what he does he cannot do behind my back. I wrote to him that I know that my appointment now depends on his report alone. I am pretty curious what Ostwald is going to write. An original idea occurred to me on the trip. It seems to me that it is not out of the question that the latent kinetic energy of heat in solids and liquids can be conceived of as the energy of electrical resonators. In that case the specific heat and the absorption spectrum would have to be interrelated. The law of Dulong & Petit would be valid for those substances whose smallest parts show a certain total resonance in the electro optical sense. In fact, all substances that satisfy the law of Dulong & Petit are almost totally opaque & seem to display almost the same spectrum when heated. On the other hand, the organic substances, which, as we have seen, display relatively small specific heats, are all transparent & show continuous absorption spectra, while, for example, Hg agrees quite well with Dulong Petit's law and is completely opaque. I almost believe that the following law holds: Dulong's law is satisfied by opaque substances only. Transparent ones have always a smaller kinetic energy. Unfortunately, gases can probably not be used for solving this puzzle because of the inconstancy of phenomena in their case. However, compounds of great "internal" energy do show band like absorption spectra. What is the story with the specific heat of glass considering its composition. It would have to have a small molecular heat, compared with its molecular number. See whether you can find something about that! What are you up to, little imp. Brew yourself often some nice coffee and don't deny yourself anything. I think much about you (entirely unspurred) and it still makes me happy that you were so cheerful on the last day we spent together. While we are at it, let me immediately kiss your darling little trap so that it the happiness won't pass. Imagine what I left in Zurich! My nightshirt & my wash things . toothbrush & comb & hairbrush. Do send everything to my sister (Töchterheim Aarau). She can later take them along with her. It's lucky that we didn't make the Axenstrasse. This would have been a nice mess. It was not even possible to see the other shore. I was traveling with two young fellows during my trip. Suddenly it turns out that one of them studied mathematics & physics in Göttingen for 4 semesters. You can imagine how I quizzed him about the conditions there. We also did a lot of shop talk about the theory of cognition. He said that Riecke is a very friendly jovial gentleman & I would have very little to do as his assistant......if if....... You know the little song we so often sang together. Here I have hardly left the house so far, and am living a quiet life instead, so that my nerves may calm down a little bit. My old folks are also contributing the best they can; the poor souls have constant aggravation and worries because of the accursed money. My dear uncle Rudolf (the rich one) picks on them terribly. Be industrious, my love, and find yourself a friendly little room in which you feel comfortable. One kisses equally well as a little doctor and professor. Did you also send a paper to Wenger?
##
Thank you very much for your little letter and all the true love that's in it. I kiss and hug you for it from all my heart, exactly the way you would want it & are entitled to, love. Riecke's rejection did not surprise me, and I am also firmly convinced that Weber is to blame. Because the excuse is too implausible, and he doesn't mention a thing about the second position. I am convinced that under these circumstances it wouldn't make any sense to write again to professors, because I am certain that all of them would turn to Weber for information once the matter had advanced far enough, and he would again give a poor reference. I'll turn to my former teachers in Aarau and Munich, but mainly I'll try to get an assistant's position in Italy. First of all, one of the main obstacles is absent here, i.e., anti Semitism, which in German countries would be as unpleasant as it is obstructive, and, second, I have quite good connections here. That is to say, Mr. Ansbacher is a close friend of the professor of chemistry at the Milan Polytechnicum, and, further, Michele's uncle is a professor of mathematics. It is true that Michele is a terrible schlemiel but I'll grab him by the scruff of his neck and drag him along to his uncle & once I am there I'll do my own talking. At present Michele is at his parents' in Trieste with wife and child and will only be back in about 10 days. You need not fear that I will say a single word about you to him or anyone else. You are and remain to me a shrine which nobody is allowed to enter; I also know that of all the people it's you who loves me most deeply and understands me best. I can also assure you that nobody here would dare or want to say anything bad about you. How happy and proud I will be when the two of us together will have brought our work on the relative motion to a victorious conclusion! When I see other people then it really strikes me how much there is to you. On the evening of the day before yesterday, Michele's director, with whom we are rather well acquainted, was at our house for music making. He said how totally unusable and almost mentally incompetent not responsible for his actions in a legal sense. Michele is, despite his extraordinarily extensive knowledge. The most delectable is the following little story, whose veracity can be vouched for, since the person in question knows about my friendship with Michele & has reason to fear that the thing will be reported to him... Once again, Michele had nothing to do. So his principal sends him to the Casale power station to inspect and check the newly installed lines. Our hero decides to leave in the evening, to save valuable time, of course, but unfortunately he missed the train. The next day he remembered the commission too late. On the third day he went to the train on time, but realized, to his horror, that he no longer knew what he had been requested to do; so he immediately wrote a postcard to the office, asking that they should wire him what he was supposed to do!! I think the man is not normal. Concerning the problem of specific heat, which at the same time encompassses the relationship between temperature and radiation process, I can now think of very simple consequences for metals, which perhaps might be checked using experiments that have already been done. Let the amplitude of a train of waves progressing with a  "ÖC x certain wave length in the direction +x be Ie , where I is a constant. Further, if N is the number of radiation resonators (atoms) in a unit volume, then a/N shall be independent of the nature of the substance and linearly dependent on the temperature. Hence a/N would be a function of the form L1(ä)T + L2(A) which is independent of the nature of the metal. First we would have to investigate whether a can be determined by experiments on reflected light, and to what extent the experiments done so far can be used for deciding the question. I burn with desire to work my way into this, because I hope that it will be possible to make a gigantic step in the exploration of the nature of latent heat. Don't forget to look up to what extent glass obeys the law of Dulong and Petit. Keep my umbrella for the time being. We will then see what to do about it. If only I would succeed in getting a position, so that we can go on a little trip in summer.

A few weeks ago I took the liberty of sending you from Zurich a short paper which I published in Wiedemann's Annalen. Because your judgment of it matters very much to me, and I am not sure whether I included my address in the letter, I am taking the liberty of sending you my address hereby.
##
It's already a long time ago since I received your dear good little letter & could not yet answer it, my days are so filled up, mostly with stupid stuff. Secretly I look forward to being away from home again because it is difficult to work here solidly. About Max Planck's studies on radiation, misgivings of a fundamental nature have arisen in my mind, so that I am reading his article with mixed feelings. On the other hand, I have in my hands a study by Paul Drude on the electron theory, which is written to my heart's desire, even though it contains some very sloppy things. Drude is a man of genius, there is no doubt about that. He also assumes that it is mainly the negative electric nuclei without ponderable mass which determine the thermal and electric phenomena in metals, exactly as it occurred to me shortly before my departure from Zurich. Michele arrived with wife and child from Trieste the day before yesterday. He is an awful weakling without a spark of healthy humaneness, who cannot rouse himself to any action in life or scientific creation, but an extraordinarily fine mind, whose working, though disorderly, I watch with great delight. Yesterday evening I talked shop with him with great interest for almost 4 hours. We talked about the fundamental separation of luminiferous ether and matter, the definition of absolute rest, molecular forces, surface phenomena, dissociation. He is very interested in our investigations, even though he often misses the overall picture because of petty considerations. This is inherent in the petty disposition of his being, which constantly torments him with all kinds of nervous notions. The day before yesterday he went on my behalf to see his uncle Prof. Jung, one of the most influential professors of Italy & also gave him our paper. I met the man once before & must admit that he impressed me as quite an insignificant person. He promised that he will write to the most important professors of Italy (physicists), Righi & Battelli, on my behalf, i.e., ask them whether they need an assistant. This is already quite a lot, because he seems to be on very friendly terms with them. In addition, I applied at the Polytechnikum Stuttgart, where a position is vacant & wrote again to Ostwald. Soon I will have honored all physicists from the North Sea to the southern tip of Italy with my offer! You were absolutely right, love, to go again to the Engelbrechts. Judging by previous experience, it is still the best place to be. If I will have earned some money by summer, we will surely take our little trip to Venice or somewhere else together. How delighted I would be! After all, I am quite a stranger here & now recognize quite clearly what the little sweetheart's love is compared with parental love. This is as different as day and night. I kiss you therefore with all my heart and you should know that your devotion makes me so happy that without it my life would be unspeakably bleak. You are right to go often to concerts, particularly to the splendid mass of Bach. Write me how did you like it. But now I must be off to the library, otherwise it will be getting too late.  
##
If you knew better your power over me, you little witch, you would not constantly be afraid that I might keep back all sorts of things from you, because this is really not my intention. I also want to tell you immediately, love, that my courage and my good cheer have not been broken at all, especially because I see from your letter that you are invariably cheerful. So, today I am going to give you a detailed report about myself because I see that you like that. Last week I studied electrochemistry and chemical reactions from Michele's "Ostwald", and the electron theory of metals in the library. It's easy to explain what is setting me against Planck's considerations on the nature of radiation. Planck assumes that a completely definite kind of resonators (fixed period and damping) causes the conversion of energy to radiation, an assumption I cannot really warm up to. Maybe his newest theory is more general. I intend to have a go at it. Dude's theory of electrons is a kinetic theory of electric and thermal phenomena in metals, entirely in the spirit of the kinetic theory of gases. If it only weren't for the stupid magnetism, with which we know so little what to do! Still, I do believe that Dude is on the right track, and his conception actually receives quite creditable confirmation by experiment. I'll tell you more about it another time. I have also somewhat changed my idea about the nature of latent heat in solids because my views on the nature of radiation have again sunk back into the sea of haziness. Perhaps the future will bring something more sensible! Ostwald hasn't written to me (ever), neither has a professor in Stuttgart to whom I had turned, and there is just as little in prospect for me in Italy. But I am not the least discouraged & have already weaned myself of the anger, which, after all, stemmed mainly from injured vanity. Battelli is in Pisa & Righi in Bologna. Prof. Jung, Michele's uncle, promised that he'll recommend me there. Since then, I haven't learned anything. But, as I said, I am not put out, otherwise I certainly would already have poured out my heart to you, you dear, good soul, the way I got accustomed to a long time ago. Now, I'll also tell you why I have so much to do. All the time I am performing the duties of a cicerone. For Prof. Winterer, to whom of course I must devote myself a great deal, is now here for the Easter vacation. He is an old village school principal, regardless of what he says, but intelligent all the same, and above all unprejudiced. He ignores the "casus belli," saying, girl matters..... private matters, and prefers to talk with me about other things. I must provide similar services also to a couple of ladies who are visiting with Mrs. Ansbacher. They say, correctly:"Albert has time, after all... he is also a good fellow." Maya is now also here, and is very venomous toward me. To think that girlish unselfishness is so alien to her! In contrast, how good you are, my dear, faithful girl! Therefore, we will make our little summer trip together for sure, even if we have to steal the funds for it. Just keep the money I gave you, you are the best safekeeper. Also, nobody needs to know that you have something of mine. I am very glad that you like so much to be at Miss Engelbrecht's again. She is also one of the few who deserve to be called human, she is a capable person. Now it's again your special turn, love. Be kissed, hugged, and loved, the way your faithfulness deserves it. I think so often about it every day. Miezchen is now working hard again, but in the evening I think, now she thinks of me with love, and kisses her pillow in the bed. I know how it's done!

I have learned through a friend from college that you have a vacancy for an assistant. I am taking the liberty of applying for that position. I studied at the department for mathematics and physics of the Zurich Polytechnikum for 4 years, specializing in physics. I obtained there my diploma last summer. Of course, I will make my grade transcripts available to you with pleasure. I have the honor to submit to you by the same mail a reprint of my article that has appeared recently in Annalen der Physik.

When I found your letter yesterday, I was deeply moved by your devotion and compassion which did not let you forget your old luckless friend. I really believe it quite unlikely that anyone had better colleagues than I had in you and Ehrat. I don't have to tell you that I would be delighted to get such a nice sphere of activity and that I would spare no effort to live up to your recommendation. I came here to my parents three weeks ago in order to search from here for an assistant's position at a university. I could have found one long ago had it not been for Weber's underhandedness. All the same, I leave no stone unturned and do not give up my sense of humor...God created the donkey and gave him a thick hide. We have here a splendid spring, and the whole world smiles at one so happily that one automatically sheds the old hypochondriac self. In addition, my musical acquaintances protect me here from getting sour. As for science, I have a few splendid ideas, which now only need proper incubation. I am now convinced that my theory of atomic attraction forces can also be extended to gases, and that it will be possible to obtain the characteristic constants of almost all elements without great difficulty. That will then also bring the problem of the inner kinship between molecular forces and Newtonian action at a distance forces much nearer to its solution. It is possible that experiments already done by others for other purposes will suffice for the testing of the theory. In that case I shall utilize all the already existing results in my doctoral dissertation. It is a glorious feeling to perceive the unity of a complex of phenomena which appear as completely separate entities to direct sensory observation. Please give my kindest regards to your dear family and my warm thanks to your father for his efforts and the trust he had shown by recommending me.

Don't be angry for my not following your summons to Lugano. At the end of the last week I was in the dumps because, once again, several job hunts of mine were not showing any progress. But just wait, love, in a few weeks we shall see each other all the same you are surprised, aren't you? Yesterday I received a letter from Prof. Rebstein from the Technicum Winterthur asking me whether I would like to substitute for him from 15 May to 15 July, because he is due for military service. You can imagine how gladly I'll do that! It's true that I have to teach about 30 hours a week, including even descriptive geometry, but the brave Swabian is not afraid. But that's not all. The evening before yesterday I received a letter from Marcel in which he informs me that probably I will soon get a permanent position in the Office for the Protection of Intellectual Property patent office in Bern! Isn't this almost too much at once? Imagine what a wonderful job this would be for me! I'll be mad with joy if something should become of that! Think of it, how nice it is of the Grossmanns to have exerted themselves on my behalf even now. This Rebstein is probably Hertzog's former assistant, whom we knew, actually. As for science, I've got an extremely lucky idea, which will make it possible to apply our theory of molecular forces to gases as well. You certainly remember that the force function appears explicitly in the integrals that have to be evaluated for the calculation of diffusion, thermal conduction & viscosity. Hence, with gas molecules, only our constants c are necessary for the calculation of these coefficients for ideal gases, and one does not have to venture into the theoretically so uncertain area of deviations from the ideal gas state. I can hardly await the outcome of this investigation. If it leads to something, we will know almost as much about the molecular forces as about the gravitational forces, and only the law of the radius will still remain unknown. Unfortunately, I must also admit that this idea for the investigation of salt solutions rested on such a weak basis that I think that one should first restrict oneself to the investigation of infinitely dilute solutions, in which an interaction between the molecules of the dissolved substance does not yet occur. One can so determine a great number of c's, which could be used for an approximate verification of the hypothesis of the kinship with gravitation. It is possible that information about the law of action itself will more likely be provided by the quantities cPT, volume and the integrals from the theory of gases. Could you send me Kirchhoff's Heat. I would be pleased to send the Popular Books on Natural Sciences directly to your sister, if you don't mind. To what address should they be sent? And how are you, dear girl? You shouldn't invest the savings for that altruistic goal, we may need all of it in summer on the Simplon. Oh, how glad I am! Now we will quite certainly be able to go. One really has to have respect for the Chinesenschn Chinese Schn. unidentifiable abbreviation. He now fills me too with respect. So, now you are my little frog! We shall see how things stand with that. Professor Winteler is leaving today, the Bessos are moving tomorrow to Trieste though I didn't overestimate his erudition, I overestimated by far his other qualities. He is a creature without marrow and bone.
##
I don't give in! You must absolutely come to see me in Como, sweet little witch. This will take very little of your time and cause me heavenly delight. We will be back in 3 days and can arrange it so that Sunday too is still included. You'll see how lively and gay I have become and how I've got rid of all the brow knitting. And I love you again so much! It was only because of nervousness that I was so awful to you. You will hardly recognize me, I've become so lively and gay and am longing very much to see my dear good Doxerl again. Don't you worry about the position in Zagreb, if they mess it up there. You are 1000 times more important to me than you could be to all the people of Zagreb! Who is standing in your way there, tell me a little about it. If you don't get it, that position, but I really get to be employed in Bern, then I'll appoint you herewith my dear little natural scientist. No need for you to go to a one horse town, dear girl, I value my "old pair of boots," as you always said, more than you think. Also, you need not envy any of your girlfriends, because as long as I have any desire and strength in me, I will feel happy being yours, and you will be a little shrine to me. And my happiness is your happiness. If you knew what you mean to me, you wouldn't envy any of your girl friends; because in all modesty I believe that you have more than all of them. But be it as it may, come to me to Como and bring along my blue dressing gown, into which we can wrap ourselves & by no means forget your opera glasses. In addition, bring along a gay, light little heart and a fresh head. You never had such a marvelous trip, this I already can promise you, even if it rains cats and dogs. As soon as I get a definitive report from Winterthur, I'll write you immediately, so that you can determine the day and hour when I may wait for you. At present I am again studying Boltzmann's theory of gases. Everything is very nice, but there is too little stress on the comparison with reality. I think, however, that O. E. Meyer has enough empirical material for our investigation. If you once go to the library, you may check it. But this can wait until my return to Switzerland. In general, I think that the book deserves to be studied more carefully. It occurred to me recently that when light is generated, direct conversion of motional energy to light may take place because of the parallelism kinetic energy of the molecule’s absolute temperature spectrum (radiating space energy in the state of equilibrium). Who knows when a tunnel will be dug through these hard mountains! I am very curious whether our conservative molecular forces will hold good for gases as well. If here too the mathematically so unclear concept of molecular size does not manifest itself in the formation of the trajectories of molecules coming close to each other, but the molecule can be conceived as center of force. We shall get quite a precise test of our view.

If you by chance ever happened to think of me, you surely considered me very ungrateful because I had left Zurich without even saying good bye to you. Though this embarrassing thought often crossed my mind, I couldn't bring myself to write to you, because I always wanted to wait until I'd be able to report some pleasant news about myself and this has been going on exactly until today. That is to say, I have been asked to take over the teaching of mathematics at the Technikum Winterthur from 15 May to 15 July, as their professor will be on military duty during that time. I am beside myself with joy about that, because today I received the news that everything has been definitely arranged. I have not the slightest idea as to who might be the humanitarian who recommended me there, because from what I have been told, I am not in the good books of any of my former teachers, and I did not apply for the job but received an invitation. There is also a chance that I'll get a steady job in the Swiss patent office later on. And now what should I say about all the generosity and fatherly friendliness with which you favored me whenever I had the privilege of visiting with you? I know that you no doubt know it and that you do not want to hear about it. But that much is certain, nobody has been as kind to me as you have been, and more than once I went to your place in a sad or bitter mood and always regained there my joyfulness and inner equilibrium. But so that you do not laugh at me too much, I must add immediately that I know quite well that I am a cheerful fellow and barring an upset stomach or something of that kind, I have no talent whatsoever for melancholic moods. I hope that your wife is quite well again, that she is so well, in fact, that you were able to take a trip during the Easter vacation, as you have frequently done before. Since Miss Dora has certainly passed her examination splendidly, I am sending her my cordial congratulations. With Mrs. Ansbacher I have visited very often during my stay here, mostly while her sister from Augsburg was here with her daughter, who studies music. Luigi is now taking an additional semester in Leipzig, after having completed his studies in Pavia last year. He finds his teachers there excellent, incomparably better than those in Berlin, of course I do not know which professors he has in mind. Shortly I will cross Spluegen on foot so as to combine the pleasant duty with a nice pleasure. When I then get to Zurich I will not deprive myself of looking you up.

My first greeting from here shall belong to you, love. Now let me first tell you what has happened to me since we parted. First, I went to the Hotel Limmathof, where there was no room for me after they scrutinized me in my dubious suit from head to toe. Then I went to the Hotel Central, where they just barely granted me shelter against advance payment of 2.50 fr. This morning Mrs. Hägi received me very amiably and helped me pack my little suitcase and wanted with all her might to force some food upon me. She is better after all than we thought. Old Stern was very happy about my having been invited here, & Maier's son, who studied mining science, is in East Siberia in a place where at a certain depth the ground remains frozen all year long & in winter the temperatures are sometimes as low as 50° below zero. After that, I had lunch at Orsini's with one of the young men from Bahnhofstrasse & took off for Winterthur at 3 o'clock. In front of the railway station, I immediately met Rebstein, who fixed a meeting for me at the Technikum for tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, so that I can get an idea about the way I have to teach. I am looking forward to my work with great joy. Rebstein told me that he thought of me himself, and that Amberg and Ehrat recommended me to him; well meaning people do exist, after all. Then I went to the young Wohlwend at his office, who was awfully glad to see me. I rented a room at his landlady's (Äussere Schaffhauserstr. 38) and will eat in his boarding house. You have no idea how charming and clean my room is! A large room with a double window, a verandah with a glass door and a most friendly view, parquet floor, an unspeakably comfortable sofa and beautiful carpets, a few nice pictures in short, really ideal. Also, everything spick and span and clean. If you could only see it. The house is a pretty villa outside the little town, which now, in the most beautiful season, gives the impression of a flower garden. Have you now given a good rest to your dear little feet and are you now all fresh in body and spirits again? If only I could give you some of my happiness, so that you would never be sad and wistful. I don't know yet whether I'll come Sunday, because this happens to be the only day on which I can find Grossmann at home. But I might come to you early in the morning, have lunch with you and then go to Thalweil only in the afternoon. I must think about it some more. Now I have to fetch Wohlwend.

I bet you are puzzled by the funny piece of paper on which I am writing to you. But I think, my Doxerl doesn't mind, seeing that I don't have any other one. Don't be angry for my not having written you for so long, I simply haven't much to say that you don't know already. So I help myself out with what always stays lovely and nice. I am fond of you, my dear girl, and am looking forward to seeing you again on Sunday. We shall again spend an enchanting cozy day together. Only the thought of you gives my life here a true meaning. If only the thought had a little life and flesh and blood! How delightful it was the last time, when I was allowed to press your dear little person to me the way nature created it, let me tenderly kiss you for that, you dear good soul! How is your work going, dear sweetheart? Everything proceeding jolly well. Does old Weber behave decently, or does he again have "critical theorems"? The local Prof. Weber is very nice to me and shows interest in my investigations. I gave him our paper. If only we would soon have the good fortune to continue pursuing this lovely path together. But destiny seems to bear some grudge against the two of us. But this will make things all the more beautiful later on, when all obstacles and worries have been overcome. My parents seem to be down and out once again, because they asked me to send Maja 100 50 fr. On 8 August they will have their silver anniversary. How sad I will feel during this little celebration! Papa again reminded Michele that he should write to me, thus far in vain! But all that doesn't matter. After all, I have you and your love!
##
I don't want to go to bed without answering your dear little letter, which I saw today lying on the table when I came home from the school a most darling little letter. I am so much looking forward to Sunday with my dear Doxerl. Be cheerful, dear Doxerl, and don't worry you are my dear, good sweetheart, whatever may happen. I am not very satisfied with my theory of thermoelectricity. I am not going to publish it for the time being. Perhaps I'll write a private letter to Drude to draw his attention to his mistakes. This evening I sat 2 hours at the window and thought about how the law of interaction of molecular forces could be determined. I've got a very good idea. I'll tell you about it on Sunday. I have not received any reply whatsoever from my sister. She is now in the midst of that awkward age of a girl's adolescence. If only she will come out of it alright. Michele hasn't yet written me either. I think I'll turn to his father and ask him whether he can find me a position in insurance. That's a stupid matter about being a starveling. But otherwise, he is a splendid fellow, your sweetheart is, even if somewhat unlucky. Writing is stupid. Sunday I am going to kiss you orally.

I have just read a marvelous paper by Lenard on the production of cathode rays by ultraviolet light. Under the influence of this beautiful piece of work, I am filled with such happiness and such joy that you absolutely must share in some of it. Just be of good cheer, love, and don't fret. After all, I am not leaving you and I'll bring everything to a happy conclusion. It's just that one has to be patient! You'll see that one doesn't rest badly in my arms, even if it starts a little stupidly. How are you, love? How is the boy? Imagine how lovely it will be when we will again be able to work together totally undisturbed, and nobody will any longer be allowed to interfere! You will be amply compensated for your present worries by a lot of joy, and the days will peacefully pass by, undisturbed and unhurriedly. I was alone all day long yesterday because Wohlwend was in Lenzburg, and I studied Wiedemann's Annalen after having taken a very lovely walk through the woods in the morning. I found there a numerical confirmation which a Dutchman had found for the fundamental principles of the electron theory, which filled me with real delight and completely convinced me about the electron theory. Wohlwend also went to see the Wintelers, but of course said nothing there about me, only a little something to my sister, to whom I am now going to write. Distance seems to have softened her grudges against me very much. I'll invite her here for a Sunday. How are our little son and your doctoral thesis? If I am not mistaken, Weber also once did theoretical work on the motion of heat in metal cylinders. See whether you couldn't somehow use the tables on this basis, even if only ostensibly. I think that he is cited in Heine. Unfortunately, no one here at the Technikum is up to date in modern physics & I have already tapped all of them without success. Would I too become so lazy intellectually if I were ever doing well? I don't think so, but the danger seems to be great indeed. Unfortunately, I learned today that there is quite some competition between mathematicians in Switzerland too. In Germany it is supposed to be much worse. I have already wondered whether old Besso couldn't find a job for me in insurance. After all, he is the general manager of a company. Don't get any silly ideas, I'll do everything I can to stand up for you, love.

What do you think is lying on the table in front of me? A long letter addressed to Drude with two objections to his electron theory. He will hardly have anything sensible to refute me with, because the things are very simple. I am terribly curious whether and what he is going to reply. Of course, I also let him know that I don't have a job, that goes without saying. I already told you what it is all about. I got a postcard from my sister. She is not coming to visit me. Imagine, the Wintelers railed against me at the Wohlwends' & said that I have been leading a life of debauchery in Zurich. Nothing beats the "eternal feminine." Supposedly Byland didn't behave too nicely either. He would seem to fit much better the words bellowed during the instruction hour by a good German sergeant about Napoleon I: "He was a very good soul.... but stupid, stupid, terribly stupid." How are you, dear sweetheart? Let me hear from you soon! Do you still remember how clumsy I was the last time? But I didn't write anything about that to good old Drude, would you believe it? How are your studies and the child and the child mood? I hope that all three are fine, as it should be. I am sending you special kisses so that there should never be a lack of good mood. The future will bring with it whatever the present leaves to be desired, and lots of it. If Michele doesn't write soon, I'll write him again to ask for a position for me from his strict Herr Papa. If one doesn't do splendidly, one's good friends tend to leave one in the lurch. But this is how it goes. I really do have your little jacket. I'll bring it with me next time. Yesterday I again played music at the place of the older miss., It was great. If only you could have been there too! You badly need a nice change. I still have to give a private lesson in algebra this evening. I am looking forward to next Sunday. If only we could be together carefree and in good cheer for once, without any pressure on us. I believe that you cannot imagine yourself in such a situation any more than I can, you good poor girl.

I have learned that your institution has a vacancy for the chair of Strength of Materials and am taking the liberty of applying for that post. I have been living in Switzerland for almost 6 years and have obtained Swiss (Zurich) citizenship during that time. In the Fall of 1896, I graduated from the Kantonsschule in Aarau and after that I enrolled in the School for Teachers of Mathematics at the Federal Polytechnikum. There, besides the usual mathematics and physics courses, I also took courses in technical subjects, such as Strength of Materials with Prof. Hertzog, and Electrical Engineering with Prof. Weber. In the summer of the past year, I obtained there my specialized teacher's diploma. Since then, I have been working on investigations in the physics laboratory and on studies in theoretical physics. I also published a paper on capillarity in Wiedemann's Annalen. Since 15 May I have been teaching mathematics at the Technikum here in Winterthur as a substitute for Dr. Rebstein, who will be absent until 15 July because of military service. Needless to say, my records are at your disposal. For further information please contact Prof. Lüdin, Prof. Weber, Prof. Rebstein at the Winterthur Technikum, Prof. Hertzog in Zurich, and the professors at the cantonal school in Aarau. With one of the latter, Prof. Winteler, formerly of Burgdorf, I am on very friendly terms.



I have just come home from Lenzburg & found this letter from Drude, which is such irrefutable evidence of its writer’s wretchedness that no comment by me is necessary. From now on I'll not turn any longer to this kind of person but will rather attack them mercilessly via journals, as they deserve. It is no wonder that little by little one becomes a misanthrope. But now, rejoice in the irrevocable decision that I have made! I decided the following about our future: I will look immediately for a position, no matter how humble. My scientific goals and my personal vanity will not prevent me from accepting the most subordinate role. The moment I have obtained such a position I'll marry you and take you to me without writing anyone a single word before everything has been settled. And then nobody can cast a stone upon your dear head, and whoever dares to do anything against you, he'll better watch out! When you’re and my parents are faced with the fait accompli, they'll just have to reconcile themselves with it the best they can. And as my little wife, you can peacefully rest your little head in my lap and will not have to regret the tiniest bit the love and devotion you have bestowed upon me. Even though our situation is very difficult, I am again quite confident since I made this decision. First thing tomorrow I will write to old Besso and go to the director of the local insurance company, who will be able to give me further advice.

I was very happy to learn from my parents' last letter that you thought of me when you heard of a vacant teaching position in Burgdorf and that you are even ready to put in a recommending word for me there. I thank you with all my heart for your friendly offices Immediately after the receipt of this information (last Wednesday) I wrote to the director of the Burgdorf Technikum and applied for the position. The next day my colleagues told me that this teaching position involves not only mechanics and strength of materials, but also includes instruction in machine design, for which practical experience is essential. However, this does not say that the teaching of all these subjects by one teacher will also go on in the future. I have not yet received a response. I indicated that they may ask my former teachers at the Aarau cantonal school about me, and, further, that you and I are personal friends. I wrote this mainly because I thought that the gentlemen there are acquainted with you and will turn to you for information. I just don't know whether it would have been pleasant for you to give an objective judgment about me I would find an analogous situation somewhat awkward, one has to stick rigorously to the truth, and at the same time one does not like to say anything unfavorable. But in this way you can easily refrain from giving an opinion if this seems more appropriate to you. I have been quite exceptionally pleased with my activities here. It had never occurred to me that I would enjoy teaching as much as it actually proved to be the case. After having taught 5 or 6 classes in the morning, I am still quite fresh and work in the afternoon either in the library on furthering my education or at home on interesting problems. I cannot tell you how happy I would feel in such a job. I have completely given up my ambition to get a position at a university, since I see that even as it is, I have enough strength and desire left for scientific endeavor. There is no exaggeration in what you said about the German professors. I have got to know another sad specimen of this kind one of the foremost physicists of Germany. To two pertinent objections which I raised against one of his theories and which demonstrate a direct defect in his conclusions, he responds by pointing out that another (infallible) colleague of his shares his opinion. I'll soon make it hot for the man with a masterly publication. Authority gone to one's head is the greatest enemy of truth. But I do not want to bore you any longer with my talk.
##
Intending to register for the vacant chair of mechanics and strength of materials at the Burgdorf Technikum, I mistakenly applied to the director of the Burgdorf Technikum. Please let me know whether my application will be taken into account or whether I have still time to send a new one to the Department of Education.

Thank you with all my heart for your dear little postcard. But Herr. Adjunkt has come to naught. I asked Haller by phone & got a negative answer. I had expected that from the start because this is an administrative position. I am now getting along somewhat better with my mother. But she suspects something. That is to say, she believes I'll marry you as soon as I have a job: as a matter of fact, my sister told her that that little postcard was from you. And now, I wish you the best of luck for your exam & may it pass quickly, dear sweetheart. I think that we should then immediately take a little trip as a redress, but only over the Klausen, because we must economize a little & the cost difference is quite significant. Don't you agree? I am working on a theory of the liquid surface all the time, but totaly unsuccessfully. All my endeavors since the paper have their deficiencies. What I said in the lecture I gave you is all wrong. Someday I'll prove it to you. It's wonderful here in Paradies. From the front verandah one has an all dominating view which reveals new charms every time. Unfortunately, all sorts of people (e.g., from Genoa) will again visit us here, which I really abhor. If only I were soon to get a position & we could vegetate together. This is my greatest desire.

With great joy have I just read in the newspaper that you have become professor at the cantonal school in Frauenfeld. I congratulate you cordially on this success, which offers you nice work and a secure future. I too applied for this position, but, in fact, I did it only so that I wouldn't have to tell myself that I was to faint hearted to apply; for I was strongly convinced that I have no prospects of getting this or another similar post. However, I too am now in the happy position of having gotten rid of the perpetual worry about my livelihood for at least one year. That is to say that as of 15 September I will be employed as a tutor by a teacher of mathematics, a certain Dr. J. Nüesch, in Schaffhausen, where I'll have to prepare a young Englishman for the Matura high school graduation examinations. You can imagine how happy I am, even though such a position is not ideal for an independent nature. Still, I believe that it will leave me some time for my favorite studies so that at least I shall not become rusty. Lately I have been engrossed in Boltzmann's works on the kinetic theory of gases and these last few days I wrote a short paper myself that provides the keystone in the chain of proofs that he had started. However, it is too specialized to be of interest to you. In any case, I'll probably publish it in the Annalen. On what stuff do you spend your free time these days? Have you too already looked at Schopenhauer's Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life? This is a part of Parerga & Paralipomena, and I liked it very much. A considerably simpler method of investigating the relative motion of matter with respect to luminiferous ether that is based on ordinary interference experiments has just sprung to my mind. If only, for once, relentless Fate gave me the necessary time and peace! When we see each other I'll report to you about it.
##
Three days have passed without my having received a letter, and as many nights. But I am so firmly convinced that you wouldn't let me wait so long, that I definitely believe that the letter got lost. Did you receive the 2 or 3 letters of mine that I mailed to Katy Hungarian spelling for Kac and the one I mailed to Neusatz German name for Novi Sad? I almost believe that your mailmen use the letters for kindling or even......horribile dictu horrible to say, but I am not saying it. From now on I am going to write you in each letter that I'll write you often, so that you won't worry and will know that everything is alright except for the negligent postal service. Except for the lack of news, I am really fine & I am almost always in good cheer. If only I could be sure that this little letter is certain to end in your hands at last. Let them occasionally check in Katy whether the letters really aren't there! I can hardly believe it. It is very cozy in the new room, even though its only ornaments are myself and the dear red lampshade, of which Mrs. Baumer said that she wouldn't do such a tremendous job even for her Karl. But I thought to myself. My dear sweetheart would do quite different things for me as well, but so would I for her. All this I have already written to you, but who knows whether you received it. I am unspeakably happy that your parents are now somewhat calmer and have more trust in me. But I also know that I deserve it and that their Miezel will get a good husband as soon as this becomes feasible. The position in Bern has not yet been advertised so that I am really giving up hope for it. Write me in detail how you are spending your day so that I can follow you a little in my imagination, I don't think that this should be too difficult to imagine. I am living here as if I were completely alone, since I do not see anybody privately. Almost every day I take a little walk to refresh myself, the rest of the time I spend studying Voigt's theoretical physics, from which book I've already learned quite a lot. The evening of the day before yesterday the local music teachers organized an evening of chamber music, which was delightful beyond my expectations. So far I have no report from Kleiner. I don't think he would dare to reject my dissertation, but otherwise, in my opinion, there is nothing that can be done with that short sighted man. If I had to be at his beck and call to become a university professor I wouldn't want to change jobs, but would rather remain a poor private tutor. Should I send you a book, dear sweetheart, or do you have some other fulfillable wish? Write it to me without hesitation but write me much. Each letter makes me very happy. They are the only human pleasure that gladdens my mind. They must substitute for wifey, parents, friends and company, and they can do it, too. Of course, it would be nicer if I could have you with me as in the good old student days in Zurich. As soon as I become a doctor, I'll put in an advertisement in order to seek a secure position. One of these days we shall have external luck as well. When you'll have your fill of being at home, come to me, you'll always be received with open arms, we will manage somehow.

I received your dear belly ache letter, which you were so nice to write me in bed. But I am not worried at all, because I see from your good mood that the problem is not so serious. Take good care of yourself and be cheerful and rejoice in our dear Lieserl, whom I in absolute secrecy, to be sure (so that Doxerl wouldn't notice it), prefer to think of as Hanserl. There is a lot of news in my case, some good and some not. First of all, it should be noted that Kleiner hasn't written yet. The second is that Louis' mother whines terribly about our emigration project. She declared that she doesn't mind the money (she must have almost as much of it as the two of us together, don't you agree?). Also, he shouldn't cause her worries and excitement, she really has enough of those (her husband suddenly became insane in August). I advised him therefore to give up the plan. Besides, there was the danger present that I might fall between two stools if I persisted with the plan. Imagine in what an awful fix we would have been then! I therefore decided to set up myself here as comfortably as possible. I therefore went to Nuesch and told him to give me the money for the meals, so that eventually I might save a little money. He said, aflush with rage, that he has to think about it. Then he conferred with his fine little spouse. When I returned in the evening, he was very snotty and told me, with an authoritative expression: "You know our conditions, there is no reason to deviate from them. You can be quite satisfied with the treatment you are getting." To which I said: "Very well, as you like, I have to give in for the time being. I'll know how to find living conditions that suit me better." (Imagine what nerve, in my position!) He understood that and softened up immediately. He noticed that I am less concerned with saving money than with not wanting to eat with him and his fine family, swallowed his rage and told me as softly as he could: "Would you be satisfied if I arranged for your meals somewhere, in a restaurant?" I immediately understood why he wanted that so that it shouldn't be possible to calculate how much he steals from the 4,000 fr. put out for me. So I agreed happily and took my leave, remarking that he should make the arrangements as quickly as possible, I had attained my goal, after all. They are now foaming at their mouths with rage against me, but I am now as free as the next man. I have already eaten there today, it's very cozy there, I have already found quite nice company there in the persons of two young pharmacists. Long live impudence! It's my guardian angel in this world. Yesterday, as I happily entered the house N. for the last dinner, just before the subscription concert at which I participated, there was a letter from Marcelius on my soup plate, a very kind letter, in which he tells me that the position in Bern will be advertised within the next few weeks and that he takes it for certain that I'll get it. In 2 months' time we would then suddenly find ourselves in splendid circumstances and our struggle would be over. I am dizzy with joy when I think of it. I am even happier for you than for myself. We would be the happiest people on earth together, that's for sure. We shall remain students (horribile dictu) as long as we live, and shall not give a damn about the world. But neither shall we forget that we owe everything to the kind Marcelius, who tirelessly looked out for me. Also, I will always help gifted young men wherever this will be within my powers, this is a solemn oath I am taking. The only problem that would remain to be solved would be how to have our Lieserl with us; I wouldn't like for us to have to part with her. Ask your father, he is an experienced man and knows the world better than your impractical bookworm Johonzel. She shouldn't be stuffed with cow milk, this could make her stupid (yours must be much more nourishing, I believe, what do you think?!) I got again a very self evident but important scientific idea about molecular forces. You know that no noticeable evolution of heat takes place when two neutral liquids are mixed together. From this it follows, according to our theory of molecular forces, that there must exist an approximate proportionality between our constants Zc and the molecular volumes of the liquids. If this were true, then this would be the end of the molecular kinetic theory of liquids. I'll see whether I can get hold of Ostwald or Landolt during the vacation period. I'll either stay here (for reasons of economy) or go to Zurich and work (this beats all secondary considerations). My pupil has just told me that the thing with Bern is not so impossible after all. His mother seems to have become a little bit enlightened. But now this is not so important to me any longer, although it still would make me very glad. Be cheerful, my dear, faithful little sweetheart, give my kind regards to your parents, and I clasp you tenderly to my heart.

It is really a screamingly funny life that I am living here, completely in Schopenhauer's sense. That is to say, all day long I talk with nobody except my pupil. Even Mr. Baumer's company seems to me boring and insipid. I always find that I am in the best company when I am alone, except when I am with you. But you I miss very much, I find that every regular guy must have a girl. I would like so much to have you with me, even if you have a "funny figure," as you have written me twice already. Why don't you make a drawing of it for me, a really beautiful one! It will make me very happy if you make me a little pillow. But then you also must make the soul inner slip cover? for it (for the sake of the pillow), because I haven't the slightest idea where those of mine reside. You know the ghastly disorder that reigns among my worldly goods & it is really lucky that I don't have much. My new eating arrangement at the inn suits me quite well, in any case it is an enormous improvement, so that my moving to Bern, with my pupil, I mean, does not seem desirable any longer. But the people with whom I am eating here seem to me too stupid and commonplace. So I am sitting at the meals like a nutcracker & am playing with knife and fork between courses, while looking out of the window. The fellows must think that I have never laughed in my whole life; but, then, they have never seen me with my Doxerl. I am now working very eagerly on an electrodynamics of moving bodies, which promises to become a capital paper. I wrote to you that I doubted the correctness of the ideas about relative motion. But my doubts were based solely on a simple mathematical error. Now I believe in it more than ever. Since that bore Kleiner hasn't answered yet, I am going to drop in on him also: to take him to task; untranslatable pun on Thursday. I want to induce him at all costs to let me work during the Christmas vacation. I'll see whether I'll succeed in that. To think of all the obstacles that these old philistines put in the way of a person who is not of their ilk, it's really ghastly! This sort instinctively considers every intelligent young person as a danger to his frail dignity, this is how it seems to me by now. But if he has the gall to reject my doctoral thesis, then I'll publish his rejection in cold print together with the thesis & he will have made a fool of himself. But if he accepts it, then we'll see what a position the fine Mr. Drude will take... a fine bunch, all of them. If Diogenes were to live today, he would look with his lantern for an honest person in vain. I'll soon mail a small parcel for you and your sister, but nothing to eat, it's all reading stuff. Just don't you believe now that a lot is coming, it's not much but it's from the heart. But you must rejoice in it and think: "If he had more, he would send me more, my sweetheart." This is how you must think, right?! Give my kind regards to your old lady & tell her also that I am looking forward to the thrashing she will bestow upon me one of these days.

I, the undersigned, take the liberty of applying for the position of Engineer Class II at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, which was advertised in the Bundesblatt Federal Gazette of 11 December 1901. I obtained my professional education in physics and electrical engineering at the School for Specialist Teachers of Mathematics and Physics at the Federal Polytechnikum in Zurich, which institution I attended from the Fall of 1896 to the Summer of 1900. There I obtained the Federal Diploma for Specialist Teachers after completion of my studies, based on an experimental project in physics and the successfully passed examination. From the Fall of 1900 to the Spring of 1901 I lived in Zurich as a private teacher. At the same time I perfected my education in physics and wrote my first scientific paper. From 15 May to 15 July I was a substitute teacher of mathematics at the Technikum in Winterthur. Since 15 September 1901 I have been a tutor in Schaffhausen. During the first two months of my working here I wrote my doctoral dissertation on a topic in the kinetic theory of gases, which I submitted to Section II of the Faculty of Philosophy at Zurich University a month ago. The documents that corroborate my statements are now at Zurich University, but I hope that I will be able to send them to you in a few days. I am the son of German parents, but I have been living in Switzerland without interruption since age 16. I am a citizen of the City of Zurich.

Good news once again! But stop, first my belated cordial congratulations on your birthday yesterday, which I forgot once again. But now listen & let me kiss you and hug you with joy! Haller has written me a friendly letter in his own hand, in which he requested that I apply for a newly created position in the patent office! Now there is no longer any doubt about it. Grossmann has already congratulated me. I am dedicating my doctoral thesis to him, to somehow express my gratitude. He has shown that he is a splendid fellow! And soon you'll become my happy little wife, you just watch and see. Our troubles have now come to an end. Only now that the terrible pressure of circumstances does not weigh upon me any longer do I really see how much I love you! I am sure that everything will be decided soon. Now I'll soon be able to clasp my Doxerl in my arms and to call her mine in front of the whole world. You'll soon be my "student" again, exactly as in Zurich. Are you glad? Today I spent the whole afternoon with Kleiner in Zurich and explained my ideas on the electrodynamics of moving bodies to him & otherwise talked with him about all kinds of physical problems. He is not quite as stupid as I thought, and, moreover, he is a good guy. He said I may refer to him whenever I need a recommendation. Isn't that nice of him? He must go away during the vacation and he hasn't read the thesis yet. I told him to take his time, I am in no hurry. He advised me to publish my ideas about the electromagnetic theory of light of moving bodies together with the experimental method. He thought that the experimental method proposed by me is the simplest and most appropriate one conceivable. I was very pleased with the success. I shall certainly write the paper in the coming weeks. I am staying here during the vacation, but I'll spend the two feast days of Christmas with my sister in Paradies, in intimate winter solitude. If only you too could be there! But our Paradise will follow soon. I am absolutely delirious with delight. It is not yet certain whether the Englishman will come with me to Bern but under these circumstances I don't really care. The wretched old man will be surprised when I tell him about it! He is a miserable scoundrel. I've learned hair raising things about him.

I am writing to you again, because I cannot bear not to write to you. What a precious sweetheart I have & what a fine little parcel has she sent me! She even hid a magnificently fine piece of tobacco in it & a most darling little letter. I rejoiced all day long. The goodies are incomparably good & I kiss you in my thoughts each time I eat one. I have eaten almost half of it, even though it arrived only yesterday at noon. I am decidedly not in a sad mood. All the time I rejoice in the fine prospects which are in store for us in the near future. Have I already told you how rich we will be in Bern? 3,500 fr. is the minimum salary the position pays according to the advertisement, but it increases up to 4,500. Ehrat thinks, though, that one cannot live on 4,000 fr. with a wife. But we will prove by deeds how fabulously that can be done! Isn't it so, sweetheart? After all, we managed in Zurich with barely half of that & had a great time of it. I find it quite funny how fussy people are. It is true that life is supposed to be more expensive in Bern than in Zurich. But this is probably not so serious. Michele gave me a book on the theory of ether, written in 1885. One would think it came from antiquity, its views are so obsolete. It makes one see how fast knowledge develops nowadays. I now want to buckle down and study what Lorentz and Drude have written on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Ehrat must get the literature for me. Grossmann is getting his doctorate on a topic that is connected with Fiedlering fiddling: untranslatable pun and non Euclidean geometry. I don't know exactly what it is. Ehrat will do his thesis with Gaiser, as he refuses the ridiculous topic that Minkowski has proposed to him. You see, your Johonzel has been the first to finish his dissertation, even though he is a harassed little beast. When you are my dear little wife, we will zealously do scientific work together, so as not to become old philistines, right? My sister seemed to me so philistine. You must never become like that, it would be awful for me. You must always remain my witch and my street urchin. I long very much after you. If only I could have you just a little bit! Apart from you, all the people look so alien to me as if they were separated from me by an invisible wall. You should just hear Ehrat talking about marriage, it's too funny. He talks about it as about a bitter medicine that has simply to be taken dutifully. His wife will find it amusing. How differently people look at one and the same thing, it's very funny, isn't it.

I sailed away from Nuesch with spectacular effect. Come and see me when you have time, I'll tell you a good story. I would have visited you already, but it is so far & the chances of finding you at home are not great.
##
I hope that you will be up and around again by the time my letter arrives. I was scared out of my wits when I got your father's letter, because I had already suspected some trouble. External fates are nothing compared with this. At once I felt like being a tutor with Nuesch for two more years if this could make you healthy and happy. But you see, it has really turned out to be a Lieserl, as you wished. Is she healthy and does she already cry properly? What kind of little eyes does she have? Whom of us two does she resemble more? Who is giving her milk? Is she hungry? And so she is completely bald. I love her so much & I don't even know her yet! Couldn't she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? Will she soon be able to turn her eyes toward something? Now you can make observations. I would like once to produce a Lieserl myself, it must be so interesting! She certainly can cry already, but to laugh she'll learn much later. Therein lies a profound truth. When you feel a little better, you must make a drawing of her. It's delightful here in Bern. An ancient, exquisitely cozy city, in which one can live exactly as in Zurich. Very old arcades stretch along both sides of the streets, so that one can go from one end of the city to the other in the worst rain without getting noticeably wet. The homes are uncommonly clean, I saw this everywhere yesterday when I was looking for a room. It does me extremely good to have escaped from the unpleasant environment. I already saw to it that an advertisement will be published in the local gazette. I hope it will be of some help. If only I got 2 lessons per day, I could save something for you. I have a large beautiful room with a very comfortable sofa. It only costs 23 fr. This is not much, after all. In addition, 6 upholstered chairs and 3 wardrobes. One could hold a meeting in it.

Guess where I was today! At a class of forensic me pathology with demonstration ad oculos. Friend Frosch, who also happens to be here, took me along. The thing interested me so tremendously that from now on I'll go there every Saturday. A sixty year old woman was questioned, who tried to commit arson while blind drunk, as well as a man accused of swindling, who seems to suffer from megalomania. (There are interesting cases of pathological swindlers in Forel.) Because of his great intelligence, Frosch enjoys such respect on the part of the professor, that he turns to Frosch every time he made some smart remark. I then spent the rest of the afternoon with Frosch. The situation with the private lessons isn't bad at all. I have already found two gentlemen, an engineer & an architect & more in prospect. I am going to give both of them together a kind of a private course & am getting 2 fr. per man and lesson. This is quite nice, isn't it. It is going to start on the evening of the day after tomorrow. I am now expounding to Habicht the paper I have handed in to Kleiner. He is quite enthusiastic about my good ideas & nags me to send to Boltzmann the part of the paper that refers to his book. I am going to do it. I have almost finished reading Mach's book with tremendous interest, and will this evening.
##
In defiance of all my pedagogical principles, I am writing you again today, because I got such a nice little letter from you. You needn't be jealous of Habicht and Frosch, because what are they to me compared with you! I long after you every day, but I do not act that way because it's not "manly" and I always think: Joggele, you go first, you are the man after all. But it's true nevertheless that it is very nice here. But I would rather be with you in some backwater than without you in Bern, that's for sure. And no pleasure I am having here compares with that of getting a little letter from the little sweetheart. Without you even studying gives me only half the pleasure. Recently a man who used to be at the Polytechnikum in Zurich and is now employed at the patent office started a conversation with me. He finds that it's very boring there certain people find everything boring I am sure that I will find it nice and that I will be grateful to Haller as long as I live. He also told me that the advertisement in the Federal Gazette under the announcements of vacant positions does not otherwise mention "physics", but only polytechnical mechanical education. Haller inserted this for my sake. Further, the election of employees happens in such a way that Haller makes the proposal and the Federal Council appoints; hence, there is hardly any doubt. Besides, he added, a little contemptuously, the position is of the lowest rank and it is unlikely that anyone will compete with me for it. I was very glad to hear that. We two don't give a damn about "height"!

Mechanics is the science of motion of ponderable matter. It establishes the conditions under which the motion of matter ceases (statics). It seeks to reduce the manifold phenomena of motion to the smallest possible number of elementary laws of the simplest possible form, from which it seeks to reconstruct the more complicated phenomena.
##
We shall first discuss the motion of a body whose dimensions are of no importance in the motions we will discuss, that is, can be regarded as small. While in motion, such a body will, in general, carry out rotations and change its shape. But we disregard these circumstances, that is, treat it as if it were pointlike; we designate it as a "material point." Before we investigate the motion of a m. as a function of the motive causes, we must discuss the means and the auxiliary quantities that we use in order to describe the motion of an m. point.
##
One cannot speak of the motion of a body (and hence also of a m. p.) in and for itself, but only of a relative motion of bodies with respect to each other. If we wish to describe the motion of an m. p., we must describe its motion with respect to a second body. For the latter we choose a system of 3 mutually perpendicular rigid rods. (Coordinate system). We conceive of times as being measured by an arbitrary clock, in that we assume that means are available for ascertaining the readings of the clock that are simultaneous with particular individual positions that the m. p. assumes during its motion. Obviously, the motion of the body m. p. is given if the coordinates x, y, z are given with respect to the c.s. as a function of time. 
##
Velocity is a vector (structure defined by magnitude, direction, and orientation). Graphically represented by an arrow of a given direction & magnitude.
##
Galileo's principle of inertia a m.p. that is present alone in space not acted upon by other bodies moves without acceleration. In a certain sense, this law is an empirical law; (billiard ball, railway car). Strictly speaking, however, it has the character of a definition. For we say that other bodies do not act on a body if this body moves uniformly in a straight line. But for all practical purposes the law can be designated as empirical, because experience happens to be such that the law can be carried out or maintained without any artificial looking assumptions.
##
But this law does not hold for an arbitrary state of motion of the c.s. But it holds to a certain degree of approximation for systems at rest relative to the earth, and to an even closer approximation for a system whose origin is at rest relative to the center of gravity of the solar system, and whose axes are directed permanently toward 3 fixed stars.
##
The accelerations imparted by A to B, & and by B to A are directed along the connecting line and are oppositely oriented. 
The ratio of accelerations of two mat. p. defines the ratio of masses. Explanation of the empirical laws involved.
One mass can be chosen arbitrarily. The rest of the masses can be derived from it by experiment.
The addition theorem for accelerations.
If one introduces a vector (x, y, z) that is equal to the acceleration of the point multiplied by m.
Then, for two masses interacting with each other, this vector has the property of being equal for the two, and of opposite direction. We call this vector the force acting on the mass point. Thus, this force always fulfills the condition of equivalence of action and reaction. 
The equations of motion given above have the character of definitional equations for the force, thus they can be neither confirmed nor refuted by experience. Nonetheless, we could find ourselves compelled by experience to abandon them; this would happen dbc if the description of facts by means of the equations would lead to our dt2 having to assume expressions for the force components X ... in a very complicated manner. One would then reject the equations of motion as unsuitable. Example: identical springs, stretched in the same way, act in the same direction upon a free body. If the acceleration were not proportional to the number of springs acting, then it would follow from the equations that the force would also not be proportional to the number of springs. This does not represent a logical contradiction, but it would result in our presuming that we could arrive at a simpler, i.e., preferable theory of motion, if we based ourselves on other equations of motion. For our equations of motion to be useful, the expressions for the force components X etc. may not contain higher than first order time derivatives of the coordinates. Because the second derivative can be eliminated by solving the equations. However, the occurrence of higher derivatives would make a solution for the second derivative seem unjustified. We have then 3 simultaneous equations of the second order. The general integrals of these eq. contain 6 arbitrary constants. For the motion is completely determined only if, for a time t0, x . . and x y z are given. If X . . are unique functions, then the solution is thereby uniquely det. 
##
We measure time in average seconds, 1 of the aver. solar day, and lengths in cm. 1 cm is the hundredth part of the distance between two marks of a specific meter stick kept in Sevres near Paris. Besides the quantities that depend only on length and time, our equation of motion contains two additional quantities, namely m and X .. It suffices to establish a unit for one of these quantities, because the equations of motion make it possible then to establish the second one. For if we have defined a unit for m, then we can define as the unit of force that force which imparts to the unit of mass the acceleration 1. Conversely, if we have established a unit for the force, than the unit mass is that mass to which the force 1 imparts the acceleration 1. From the theoretical point of view it does not matter for which of the quantities we will establish a unit, but from a pragmatic point of view it does. A unit for the force can be defined in the following way in Paris the earth exerts a quite specific force on 1 cc water at 4°. I call this unit of force 1 gram. (In addition, the kg is also used. This definition suffers (for precise investigations) from the following drawback. If people who are not in Paris wish to measure a force accurately, they must compare the force to be measured with the force that terrestrial gravitation exerts on 1 cc water in Paris. To this extent the application of the definition is cumbersome. But the situation is different if the unit of mass (also called "gram") as the mass of one cc water at 4°. In this definition, which now in physical investigations no particular location on the earth plays a role. The mass 1 gr can be realized at once at any location at which a cm measuring rod and water are available. For this reason, this system of measures seems now generally to be used in physics. The advantage over the other system is only a formal one. At a place close to the earth's surface we imagine a coord. sys. whose Z axis is directed vertically upwards. We inquire into the motion of a material point with respect to this system. In order to solve this problem, we must know the magnitude of the force exerted by the earth on the material body. 
##
The motion takes place in the vertical plane. We choose this to be the x Z plane. In that case, we have permanently y = 0, and we obtain by direct integration of our equations. The familiar formula for free fall. By calculating the constants c from the conditions of the problem, we can solve each problem concerned with free fall.

On page 6 of your manuscript you say: "If, therefore, the oscillations of the emitting particles are subjected to certain fluctuations, these fluctuations will also manifest themselves in the intensity of the emitting light." Here you refer to the very point that first and foremost makes it seem to me that an explanation of the fluctuations of the radiation by the quantum character of the emission alone is out of the question. For, obviously, there must not exist any dependence of the statistical properties of radiation on the distance of the emitting wall. Let us compare the two cases: A receives radiation one time from the surface f and another time from F. Suppose that f and F are made of the same material and are at the same temperature. If the radiation is produced in quanta of the same finite magnitude at f and F, but is distributed over the space in spherical waves, then the fluctuations will be smaller in the second case than in the first, because a greater number of quantum like acts of emission, with a smaller percentage of the energy for each individual act, will work together. One candle produces at a distance of 1 m a strongly flickering light; 100 candles of the same kind produce at a distance of 10 m light of the same intensity but with less flicker. Further, I did not introduce the constant h in the dimensional argument that was to yield the fluctuation of the radiation pressure, because this constant just does not belong in the pure undulatory theory of radiation. As far as I see it, even at an arbitrary distance from the emitting wall, the latter theory does not allow for any fluctuations other than the fluctuations due to interference. One of these days I will recommend a more exact investigation of this problem to a doctoral candidate. Further, you consider it a weakness of the quantum conception that one cannot see how to conceive of static and stationary fields. In this matter I am definitively of the opinion that the development of relativistic electrodynamics will lead to a localization of energy different from the one we are now accustomed to assume without any good reason. Without an ether, energy continuously distributed in space seems to me an absurdity. It can also easily be shown that the localization of energy as the old action at– a distance theory had it is compatible with Maxwell's theory; one of these days I will publish this in connection with some other material. Though Faraday's intuitive representation rendered important services in the development of electrodynamics, one cannot conclude from this, in my opinion, that it must be retained in all its details.

It has already been shown in a variety of ways and it is now generally accepted that, when correctly applied in the theory of radiation, our current views on the distribution and propagation of electromagnetic energy on the one hand, and on the statistical distribution 1 of energy on the other hand, can lead to no other but the so called Rayleigh (Jeans) radiation law. Since this law is in complete contradiction with experiment, it is necessary to undertake a modification of the foundations of the theories used for its derivation; and it has often been suspected that the application of the statistical energy distribution laws to radiation or to rapidly oscillating motions (resonators) is not flawless. The following investigation shall now show that such a dubious application is not required at all, and that it suffices to apply the equipartition theorem for energy solely to the translational motion of the molecules and oscillators in order to arrive at the Rayleigh radiation law. The applicability of the law to translatory motion has been adequately proved by the successes of the kinetic theory of gases; we may therefore conclude that only a more radical and more profound change in our fundamental conceptions can lead to a law of radiation that is in better agreement with experiment. We consider a mobile electromagnetic oscillator1 that is, on the one hand, subjected to the effects of a radiation field and, on the other hand, possesses a mass m and enters into interaction with the molecules present in the radiation filled space. If the above interaction were the only one present, then the mean square value of the momentum associated with the oscillator's translatory motion would be completely determined by statistical mechanics. In our case there also exists the interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field. For a statistical equilibrium to be possible, this latter interaction must not produce any change in that mean value. In other words: The mean square value of the momentum associated with the translatory motion that the oscillator assumes under the influence of the radiation alone must be the same as that which it would assume, in accordance with statistical mechanics, under the mechanical influence of the molecules alone. This reduces the problem to the task of determining the mean square value (mv)2 of the momentum assumed by the oscillator under the sole influence of the radiation field. This mean value must be the same at time t = 0 as at time t = t.

In an important theoretical paper, Smoluchowski has shown that the opalescence of fluids near the critical state as well as the opalescence of liquid mixtures near the critical mixing ratio and the critical temperature can be explained in a simple way from the point of view of the molecular theory of heat. This explanation is based on the following general implication of Boltzmann's entropy probability principle: In the course of an infinitely long period of time, an externally closed system passes through all the states that are compatible with the (constant) value of its energy. However, the statistical probability of a state is noticeably different from zero only when the work that would have to be expended according to thermodynamics to produce the state in question from the state of ideal thermodynamic equilibrium is of the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energy of a monatomic gas molecule at the temperature under consideration. If such a small amount of work suffices to bring about, in volumes of fluid of the order of magnitude of the cube of a wavelength, a density that deviates markedly from the average density of the fluid or a mixing ratio that deviates markedly from the average, then, obviously, the phenomenon of opalescence (the Tyndall phenomenon) must take place. Smoluchowski has shown that this condition is actually fulfilled near the critical state; however, he did not provide an exact calculation of the quantity of light given off laterally through opalescence. This gap shall be filled in the following. W is commonly equated with the number of different possible ways (complexions) in which the state considered which is incompletely defined in the sense of a molecular theory by observable parameters of a system can conceivably be realized. In order to be able to calculate W, one needs a complete theory (perhaps a complete molecular mechanical theory) of the system under consideration. Given this kind of approach, it therefore seems questionable whether Boltzmann's principle by itself has any meaning whatsoever, i.e., without a complete molecular mechanical or other theory that completely represents the elementary processes (elementary theory). If not supplemented by an elementary theory or to put it differently considered from a phenomenological point of view, equation  appears devoid of content. However, Boltzmann's principle does acquire some content independent of any elementary theory if one assumes and generalizes from molecular kinetics the proposition that the irreversibility of physical processes is only apparent. For let the state of a system be determined in the phenomenological sense by the variables A1 ... Xn that are observable in principle. To each state Z there corresponds a combination of values of these variables. If the system is externally closed, then the energy and, indeed, in general, no other function of the variables is constant. Let us think of all the states of the system that are compatible with the energy value of the system, and let us denote them by Z1...Zl. If the irreversibility of the process is not one of principle, then, in the course of time, the system will pass through these states Z1... Zl again and again. On this assumption, one can speak of the probability of the individual states in the following sense: Suppose we observe the system for an immensely long period of time 0 and determine the fraction X1 of the time 0 during which the system is in the state Z1; then x1/0 represents the probability of the state Z1. The same holds for the probability of the other states Z. According to Boltzmann, the apparent irreversibility must be attributed to the fact that the states differ in their probabilities, and that the system is probably going to assume states of higher probability, if it happens to find itself in a state of relatively low probability. That which appears to be completely law governed in irreversible processes is to be attributed to the fact that the probabilities of the individual states Z are of different orders of magnitude, so that a given state Z will practically always be followed by one state, from among all the states bordering on Z, because of this one state's enormous probability as compared with the probabilities of the other states. It is this probability we have just described, for the definition of which no elementary theory is needed, which is related to the entropy in the way expressed by equation . It can easily be recognized that equation  must really be valid for the probability so defined. For entropy is a function that does not decrease in any process in which the system is isolated (within the range of validity of thermodynamics). There are other functions, too, that have this property; however, if the energy E is the only function of the system that does not vary with time, then all of these functions are of the form p(S, E), where dy/dS is always positive. Since the probability W is, as well, a function that does not decrease in any process, then W is also a function of S and E alone, or if only states of the same energy are being compared a function of S alone. That the relation between S and W given in equation  is the only possible one can be deduced, as we know, from the theorem that the entropy of a total system that is composed of subsystems equals the sum of the entropies of the subsystems. Equation  can thus be proved for all of the states Z that belong to the same value of energy. The following objection can be raised against this interpretation of Boltzmann's principle: one cannot speak of the statistical probability of a state, but only of that of a state region. The latter is defined by a portion g of the "energy surface" E(X1...kn) = 0. Obviously, W tends toward zero along with the size of the chosen portion of the energy surface. For this reason, equation  would be totally meaningless if the relation between S and W were not of a quite special kind. That is to say, lg W appears in the equation  multiplied by the very small factor R/N. If one imagines that W has been obtained for a region Gw just large enough that its dimensions lie on the border of the perceptible, then lg W will have a certain value. If the region is reduced perhaps e10 times, then the right hand side will only be diminished by the vanishingly small quantity 10(R/N) on account of the reduction in the size of the region. Thus, if the dimensions of the region are indeed chosen small compared with perceptible dimensions, but nevertheless large enough for R/N lg Gw/G to be a numerically negligible quantity, then equation  will have a sufficiently exact meaning. We have assumed so far that X1...ln determines completely, in the phenomenological sense, the state of the system in question. However, equation  also retains its meaning undiminished if we seek the probability of a state that is incompletely determined in the phenomenological sense. For let us seek the probability of a state that is defined by specific values of X1 ... Xv (where v n), while the values of Av ... Xn are left indeterminate. Among all the states with the values A1 ... Av, those values of Av ... Xn will be far and away the most frequent which make the entropy of the system at constant A1 ... Xn a maximum. In that case, equation  will hold between this maximum value of the energy and the probability of this state. § 2. On the Deviations from a State of Thermodynamic Equilibrium Let us now draw conclusions from equation  regarding the relation between the thermodynamic and statistical properties of a system. Equation  yields immediately the probability of a state if its entropy is given. We have seen, though, that this relation is not exact; instead, only the order of magnitude of the probability W of the state in question can be determined from a known S. Nevertheless, it is possible to derive exact relationships concerning the statistical behavior of a system from equation  in cases where the range of the state variables for which W has values for the kind under consideration can be regarded as infinitely small. It follows from equation  that W = const. eR . This equation is valid to an order of magnitude if each state Z is assigned a small region of the order of magnitude of perceptible regions. The order of magnitude of the constant is determined by taking into account that for the state of maximum entropy.

In his superb papers titled as above, Mr. Hertz has criticized two passages in my papers on the same topic. In the following, I will briefly comment on these criticisms, noting that what is said here is the result of an oral discussion with Mr. Hertz, in which we came to a perfect agreement regarding both points in question. 1. In the penultimate section of §13 of his second paper, Hertz criticizes a derivation that I gave of the entropy law for irreversible processes. I consider this criticism totally valid. I was not satisfied with my derivation even then, which is why I soon thereafter produced a second derivation, also cited by Mr. Hertz. 2. The comments contained in §4 of his first paper that are directed against an argument about thermal equilibrium contained in my first paper in question 2 are based on a misunderstanding caused by an all too terse and insufficiently careful formulation of that argument. However, since the topic has been adequately elucidated in works by other authors, and since, moreover, a detailed discussion of this specific point is not likely to claim much interest, I do not wish to elaborate on it here. I only wish to add that the road taken by Gibbs in his book, which consists in one's starting directly from the canonical ensemble, is in my opinion preferable to the road I took. Had I been familiar with Gibbs's book at that time, I would not have published those papers at all, but would have limited myself to the discussion of just a few points.

It turns out that when Maxwell's theory of electricity and the molecular kinetic approach are applied to some phenomena of light production and conversion, contradictions with observed facts, in particular those concerning "black body radiation" and generation of cathode rays, come to light. These contradictions can be removed by introducing the working hypothesis that in the propagation of light, energy does not fill space in a continuous manner, but that, instead, it consists of a finite number of energy quanta localized at spatial points, which move without dividing and can be absorbed and generated only as a whole. If these energy quanta impinge on a photoluminescent substance, then, according to the principle of the conservation of energy, the radiant energy emitted in an elementary process must be equal to or smaller than the incident radiant energy, and from the formula for the energy of a light quantum one arrives in a simple manner at Stokes' well known frequency rule. When cathode rays are generated by illuminating solid bodies, the energy of the light quanta is converted into the kinetic energy of electrons, and only now do we realize that the quality of cathode radiation, i.e., the velocity of electrons, can be independent of the intensity of the exciting light, while the number of ejected electrons is proportional to the number of the light quanta. But from Planck's radiation formula it is to be inferred that, hand in hand with this, there has to come about a change regarding our conception of the molecular kinetic mechanism for the transfer of energy to ions or electrons capable of oscillation (resonators), in that their energy can change only jumpwise by an integral multiple of precisely one quantum of light energy. If one also carries this mechanism over to the oscillations of the material molecules of a solid body that are due to the body's thermal motion, one arrives at a surprising elucidation of the change of specific (molecular) heats of solids with temperature, which until now had remained a total mystery.
##
I have shown in a previous paper 1 that a connection must exist between the law of radiation and the law of specific heats of solids (deviation from the Dulong Petit law). The investigations by Nernst and his students have now shown that, on the whole, specific heats indeed display the behavior deduced from the law of radiation, but that the true law of specific heats deviates systematically from the law established by theory. One of the first goals of this paper is to show that these deviations are due to the fact that the oscillations of molecules are far from being monochromatic oscillations. The heat capacity of an atom of a solid is similar to that of a strongly damped oscillator in a radiation field and not like that of an oscillator that is only slightly damped. For that reason specific heat decreases less rapidly toward zero with decreasing temperatures than the earlier theory would have it; the body behaves similarly to a mixture of resonators whose proper frequencies are distributed over a certain region. Further, it will be shown that Lindemann's formula, as well as my formula for the calculation of the proper frequencies v of atoms, can be derived by dimensional arguments, with the latter also yielding the order of magnitude of the numerical coefficients appearing in these formulas. Finally, it will be shown that the laws of heat conduction in crystallized insulators are not in accord with molecular mechanics, but that it is possible to derive the order of magnitude of the actually observable thermal conductivity by means of a dimensional argument, and thereby simultaneously to find out how the thermal conductivity of monatomic substances is probably related to their atomic weight, atomic volume, and proper frequency.
##
I showed in a recently published paper 3 that one arrives at approximately correct values for the proper frequencies of the thermal oscillations of atoms if one starts out from the following assumptions:
1. The forces binding the atoms to their positions of rest are essentially identical with the elastic forces of mechanics. 2. The elastic forces operate only between immediately neighboring atoms. To be sure, the theory is not completely determined by these two assumptions, for the elementary laws of interaction between immediately neighboring atoms can still be chosen freely to some extent. Also, it is not a priori clear how many molecules are to be viewed as "immediately neighboring." However, the specific choice of a pertinent hypothesis changes little in the results, so I will again stick with the simple assumptions I introduced in the above mentioned paper. I will also use the same notation as there. In the paper cited I imagined that each atom has 26 neighboring atoms with which it interacts elastically, and that all these atoms may be viewed as mathematically equivalent with respect to their elastic effect on the atom under consideration. The proper frequency was calculated in the following way. One thinks of the 26 neighboring atoms as being at rest, while only the atom under consideration oscillates; the latter then performs an undamped pendular oscillation, whose frequency one calculates (from the cubic compressibility). Actually, however, the 26 neighboring molecules are not at rest, but oscillate about their equilibrium position in a similar way as to the atom under consideration. Through their elastic connections with the atom considered, they influence the oscillations of the latter, so that its oscillation amplitudes in the coordinate directions are changing all the time, or what comes to the same thing the oscillation deviates from a monochromatic oscillation. Our first task is to estimate the magnitude of this deviation.

The first area of physical phenomena where a successful theoretical elucidation was achieved was that of the general attraction of masses. The laws of inertia and of the motions of celestial bodies were reduced by Newton to a simple law of motion of the mass point and to a law of interaction of two gravitating mass points. These laws have proved to hold so exactly that, from an empirical standpoint, there is no decisive reason for doubting their strict validity. If, nevertheless, scarcely a physicist might be found today who believes in the strict validity of these laws, then this is to be attributed to the transforming influence of the development of our knowledge of electromagnetic processes during the last few decades. For before Maxwell, electromagnetic processes were traced back to elementary laws that were fashioned as closely as possible on the pattern of Newton's force law. According to these laws, electrical masses, magnetic masses, current elements, etc., are supposed to exert on each other actions at a distance that require no time for their propagation through space. Then Hertz showed 25 years ago by means of his brilliant experimental investigation of the propagation of electrical force that electrical effects require time for their propagation. In this way he helped in the victory of Maxwell's theory, which replaced the unmediated action at a distance by partial differential equations. After the untenability of the theory of action at a distance had thus been demonstrated in the area of electrodynamics, confidence in the correctness of Newton's action at a distance theory of gravitation was also shaken. The conviction had to force itself through that Newton's law of gravitation does not embrace gravitational phenomena in their totality any more than Coulomb's law of electrostatics and magnetostatics embraces the totality of electromagnetic phenomena. The fact that Newton's law previously sufficed for calculating the motions of the celestial bodies is to be attributed to the fact that the velocities and accelerations of those motions are small. In fact, it is easy to demonstrate that celestial bodies whose motions were determined by electrical forces stemming from electrical charges situated on the celestial bodies would not unveil Maxwell's laws of electrodynamics to us if the velocities and accelerations of those celestial bodies were of the same order of magnitude as in the motions of the celestial bodies with which we are familiar. One would be able to describe those motions with great accuracy on the basis of Coulomb's law. Even if confidence in the comprehensive significance of Newton's action at a distance law had thus been shaken, there were still no direct reasons necessitating an extension of Newton's theory. However, such a direct reason does exist today for those who subscribe to the correctness of the theory of relativity. For, according to the theory of relativity, no means exist in nature that would allow us to send out signals with a velocity greater than that of light. On the other hand, however, it is obvious that if Newton's law were strictly valid, we would be able to use gravitation for sending out instantaneous signals from a place A to a distant place B; for the motion of a gravitating mass at A would have to result in simultaneous changes of the gravitational field at B in contradiction to the theory of relativity. But the theory of relativity not only compels us to modify Newton's theory; fortunately, it also greatly limits the possibilities for such a modification. If this were not the case, the endeavor to generalize Newton's theory would be a hopeless undertaking. In order to see this clearly, one need only imagine oneself in the following analogous situation: Assume that of all electromagnetic phenomena, only those of electrostatics are known experimentally. But one knows that electrical effects cannot propagate with superluminal velocity. Who would have been able to develop Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic processes from these data? And yet, our knowledge in the area of gravitation corresponds exactly to the case we have just invented; all we know is the interaction between masses at rest, and even this we probably know only to a first degree of approximation. The theory of relativity limits the confusing manifold of possible generalizations through the fact that, according to it, the time coordinate occurs in all systems of equations in the same manner, up to certain differences in sign, as the three spatial coordinates. This great formal discovery of Minkowski's, which is here only roughly indicated, has proved to be a tool of the greatest importance in the search for equations that accord with the theory of relativity.

In the following we shall put forward a few general postulates that can be imposed on a theory of gravitation, but not all of which must be imposed: 1. Satisfaction of the laws of conservation of momentum and energy.  2. Equality of the inertial and the gravitational mass of isolated systems.  3. Validity of the theory of relativity (in the narrower sense); i.e., the equation systems are covariant with respect to linear orthogonal substitutions (generalized Lorentz transformations), 4. The observable laws of nature do not depend on the absolute magnitude of the gravitational potential (or gravitational potentials). Physically, this means the following: The set of relations between observable quantities that one can determine in a laboratory is not changed if I bring the whole laboratory into a region of a different (spatially and temporally constant) gravitational potential. The following should be noted regarding these postulates. All theoreticians will agree with one another that postulate 1 must be adhered to. There will be no such  general consensus regarding adherence to postulate 3. Thus, M. Abraham has propounded a theory of gravitation that does not satisfy postulate 3. I could subscribe to this standpoint if, in Abraham's system, there were covariance with respect to transformations that turn into linear orthogonal transformations in regions of constant gravitational potential; but this does not seem to be the case with Abraham's theory. Thus, his theory does not contain as a special case the theory of relativity in the form in which it has developed so far, exclusive of gravitation. All of those arguments that have been put forward for the theory of relativity in its present form speak against such a theory. In my opinion it is absolutely necessary to stick with postulate 3 as long as there are no compelling reasons for not doing so; the moment we abandon this postulate, the manifold of possibilities will become indeterminable. A more careful examination is required for postulate 2, which, in my opinion, we must hold on to unconditionally until the contrary has been proved. The postulate is based first of all on the empirical fact that all bodies in a gravitational field fall with the same acceleration; we will once again have to pay attention to this important point later on. Let it only be noted here that the equality (proportionality) of the gravitational and inertial mass has been proved with great accuracy in an investigation of great importance to us by Eötvös;1 he proved this proportionality by demonstrating experimentally that the resultant of gravitation and the centrifugal force produced by the rotation of Earth is independent of the nature of the material (the relative difference between the two masses 10 7). Taken together with one of the main results of the ordinary theory of relativity, postulate 2 leads to a conclusion that shall be drawn already at this point. According to the theory of relativity, the inertial mass of a closed system (the latter being considered as a whole) is determined by its  energy. According to 2, the same must also hold true for the gravitational mass. Thus, if the state of a system changes in an arbitrary fashion but without its total energy being changed, then the distant gravitational action of the system does not change, not even if a part of the energy of the system is converted into gravitational energy. The gravitating mass is determined by its total energy, including its gravitational energy. Finally, postulate 4 probably cannot be grounded on experience. Its only justification lies in our confidence in the simplicity of the laws of nature, and we may not rely on its correctness with as much right as in the case of the other three axioms. I am well aware of the fact that postulates 2 4 better resemble a scientific declaration of faith than a firm foundation. I am also far from claiming that the two generalizations of Newton's theory to be described in the following are the only ones possible; but I dare say that at the present state of our knowledge they are the most natural ones.

The original theory of relativity is based upon the premise that all coordinate systems in relative uniform translatory motion to each other are equally valid and equivalent for the description of the laws of nature. When viewed from experience, this theory gains its main support from the fact that when we carry out experiments on earth we do not have the slightest indication that the earth moves around the sun with a considerable velocity. But the confidence we have in relativity theory also has another root. One cannot easily close one's mind to the following consideration. When K' and K are two coordinate systems in relative uniform translatory motion to each other, then these systems are completely equivalent from a kinematic point of view. We, therefore, look in vain to find a sufficient reason why one system should be more suitable as a system of reference for the formulation of laws of nature than another. Instead, we feel urged to postulate the equivalence of both systems. But this argument immediately spawns a counterargument. The kinematic equivalence of these two coordinate systems is by no means limited to the case where the two systems K and K' are in uniform translatory motion to each other. From the kinematic aspect, this equivalence also obtains, i.e., just as well, when both systems rotate uniformly relative to each other. One feels pressed toward the idea that the existing theory of relativity is in need of a considerable generalization such that the apparently unjust preference for uniform translatory motion over other relative motions has to be eliminated from the theory. Everyone who studied this subject in detail must feel the desire for such an extension of the theory. At first glance it appears that such extension of the theory of relativity would have to be rejected on physical grounds. Because: let there be a coordinate system K that is admissible in the sense of Galilei-Newton, and another system K' which is in uniform rotation relative to K; centrifugal forces will then act on masses which are at rest relative to K' while the masses which are at rest relative to K do not suffer such forces. Already Newton viewed this as proof that the rotation of K' had to be interpreted as "absolute"; in other words, that K' cannot claim the same right as K to be considered "at rest." This argument, however, is-as especially E. Mach has shown-not cogent. This is because we need not necessarily derive the existence of centrifugal forces from a motion of K'; instead, we can just as well derive them from the averaged rotational movement of distant ponderable masses in the environment, but relative to K', thereby treating K' as "at rest." If the Newtonian laws of mechanics and gravitation do not allow for such interpretation, it may well be founded in deficiencies of this theory. The following important argument also speaks in favor of a relativistic interpretation. The centrifugal force which acts under given conditions upon a body is determined by precisely the same natural constant that also gives its action in a gravitational field. In fact, we have no means to distinguish a "centrifugal field" from a gravitational field. We thus always measure as the weight of a body on the surface of the earth the superposed action of both fields named above; and we cannot separate their actions. In this manner, the point of view to interpret the rotating system K' as at rest and the centrifugal field as a gravitational field gains justification by all means. This interpretation is reminiscent of the one in the original (more special) theory of relativity where the ponderomotive acting force, upon an electrically charged mass which moves in a magnetic field, is the action of that electric field which is found at the location of the mass as seen by a reference system at rest with the moving mass. From what has been said, one already sees that gravitation must play a fundamental role in any theory of relativity that is extended along the lines we have indicated above. After all, if one changes by a mere transformation from one system of reference K to another one of K', then there exists a gravitational field relative to K' which relative to K need not be there at all. There arises the natural question: which systems of reference and which transformations should be considered as "admissible" in a generalized theory of relativity? This question can only be answered much later. For the time being we take the position to admit all coordinate systems and transformations that are compatible with the conditions of continuity, as is always demanded for theories in physics. It will turn out that the theory of relativity allows for a rather far-reaching generalization that is free of almost any arbitrariness.

There exists a profound formal difference between the theoretical conceptions physicists have formed about gasses and other ponderable bodies, and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic processes in so-called empty space. While we conceive of the state of a body as being completely determined by the positions and velocities of a very large but nevertheless finite number of atoms and electrons, we use continuous spatial functions to determine the electromagnetic state of a space, so that a finite number of quantities cannot be considered as sufficient for the complete description of the electromagnetic state of a space. According to Maxwell's theory, energy is to be considered as a continuous spatial function for all purely electromagnetic phenomena, hence also for light, while according to the current conceptions of physicists the energy of a ponderable body is to be described as a sum extending over the atoms and electrons. The energy of a ponderable body cannot be broken up into arbitrarily many, arbitrarily small parts, while according to Maxwell's theory (or, more generally, according to any wave theory) the energy of a light ray emitted from a point source of light spreads continuously over a steadily increasing volume. The wave theory of light, which operates with continuous spatial func- tions, has proved itself splendidly in describing purely optical phenomena and will probably never be replaced by another theory. One should keep in mind, however, that optical observations apply to time averages and not to momentary values, and it is conceivable that despite the complete confirmation of the theories of diffraction, reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc., by exper- iment, the theory of light, which operates with continuous spatial functions, may lead to contradictions with experience when it is applied to the phenomena of production and transformation of light. Indeed, it seems to me that the observations regarding "black-body radiation," photoluminescence, production of cathode rays by ultraviolet light, and other groups of phenomena associated with the production or con- version of light can be understood better if one assumes that the energy of light is discontinuously distributed in space. According to the assumption to be contemplated here, when a light ray is spreading from a point, the energy is not distributed continuously over ever-increasing spaces, but consists of a finite number of energy quanta that are localized in points in space, move without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated only as a whole. In this paper I wish to communicate my train of thought and present the facts that led me to this course, in the hope that the point of view to be elaborated may prove of use to some researchers in their investigations. 1. On a difficulty encountered in the theory of "black-body radiation" We shall begin by taking the standpoint of Maxwell's theory and the electron theory and consider the following case. Consider a space enclosed by completely reflecting walls containing a number of gas molecules and electrons that move freely and exert conservative forces on each other when they come very close to each other, i.e. They can collide like gas molecules according to the kinetic theory of gasses. Suppose, further, that a number of electrons are bound to points in space which are very far from each other, by forces that are directed toward these points and are proportional to the elongations from the points. These electrons, too, shall enter into conservative interactions with the free molecules and electrons when the latter come very close to them. We call the electrons bound to the points in space "resonators"; they emit and absorb electromagnetic waves of definite periods. According to the present view about the origin of light, the radiation in the space considered, found for the case of dynamic equilibrium on the basis of Maxwell's theory, must be identical with "black-body radiation" - at least if one assumes that resonators of all the relevant frequencies are present For the time being, we disregard the radiation emitted and absorbed by the resonators and look for the condition for dynamic equilibrium corresponding to the interaction (collisions) of molecules and electrons. For such an equilibrium, the kinetic theory of gasses provides the condition that the mean kinetic energy of a resonator electron must be equal to the mean kinetic energy of the progressive motion of a gas molecule. If we resolve the motion of the resonator electron into three mutually perpendicular oscillatory motions, we find for the mean value E of the energy of such a linear oscillatory motion.
